# Conflict

***Conflict*** is my first epic poem. I chanced upon an epic poem
somewhere online and remembered John Bunyan’s ***Paradise Lost***. So, I
told myself, "Why don’t you write your first epic poem?" Well, here it
is! It is rather religious but unconventional and even
thought-provoking.

I hope this "longer-than-usual" poem makes for an enjoyable and
intellectually stimulating read and even a jewel for a find. Cheers!
