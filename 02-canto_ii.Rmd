# Jahbulon

Do you seek wisdom? \
Do you seek to escape the darkness? \
Do you seek a little peace? \
Do you seek a little sanity?

Many persons crave fame; \
They want some honour, \
Some connection and affiliation \
To some powerful organisation \
But is there a price to pay? \
Is it gold so long as it glitters?

You see the determined devil \
Not only founded Islam or Mahometry \
But also raised up Freemasonry. \
He put together his codes and symbols, \
His passwords and secret hand gestures \
And codified them into his system \
Of knowledge and enlightenment. 

A little that a righteous man has \
Is better than the riches of many wicked \
And he that shall soon be rich \
Shall find that he shall have lots of sorrows.

They conspire against the God of heaven. \
Come, they say, and let us undo his cords; \
We will cast away his bands from us \
And build our own morality and values \
And teach our own laws and delights.

They have replaced Jehovah with Jahbulon; \
They have taken the great An \
And thrown him out of his throne \
And set the devil and his spouses \
In his place where righteousness \
Should have sat and ruled.

Jahbulon is the unholy trinity; \
It is composed of Jah, Bul and On. \
Jah is the usurping devil, \
Bul is Aphrodite \
And On is Baalzebub.

These three are also the interfacing entities \
That sit at the transition point \
Between the war and love groups \
Of the second band \
Of the infinite domain.

Satan is folly or foolishness, \
That is, Nabal or Nebo. \
Aphrodite is silliness; \
She is impulsive \
And has no prospect of success. \
Baalzebub is the lord of the fly, \
Even the lord or lady ruler of Satan \
And is full of envy because of Aphrodite's \
Proximity to Satan.

Satan lacks good sense and judgment; \
He is not wise \
And has little intelligence; \
He is Aphrodite's brother and twin

They call Baalzebub On \
Because they say, \
She is the prince of Grecia \
And the symbol of strength. \
She is the symbol of vitality and lust \
As of a strong man in the perverse act \
And they call Masonry a system of morality!

Baalzebub is the Egyptian Ra. \
She is the centre of sun worship, \
The Heliopolis and the centre, \
The very centre of sorcery. \
Her delights are witchcraft; \
She is most perverse.

Baalzebub is Freyja of Friday, \
The Norse goddess of love, battle and death. \
She is the one who rides a wild boar \
Or flies in a chariot pulled by cats. \
Her golden necklace, the Brisingamen, \
Crafted by the dwarves of Satan, \
Spits the poison her heart manufactures.

Marduk is Frigg of Friday, \
Satan's, that is, Odin's wife. \
She is the Norse goddess of magic
Or foresight or ``prophecy'' and motherhood. \
Her spinning wheel puts her \
At the level of the cherubim of Ezekiel. \
Like Heilel, she thinks herself a cherub.

With her spindle, she spins lies \
And weaves destinies into destruction \
And shame and agony \
And does not spare herself. \
Aprodite calls out the number 1; \ 
An, she says \
While Marduk calls out 3; \
The trinity she proposes.

Sin comes out; \
Let him say 4 or be silent; \
A rapid change happens in the fourth year; \
The fourth year is 2022. \
Sin is bold; he is a storm like Hadad.

Baalzebub says 7 \
According to the number \
Of shiva and Shiva; \
Satan, that is, Moloch, declares 13; \
Thirteen it is!

Baalzebub wants me to mourn, \
She wants me to yalal \
For a full week of years. \
Is she obsessed with the Ethiopian skin \
And with the Queen of Sheba?

She has sevened herself; \
She has taken the oath \
Like the Angel swore and cursed. \
She has taken the oath \
And sworn by herself, Marduk and Satan \
That I shall not take the oath.

I will give Baal 2 \
And Hermes 5; \
Shadel shall be 6.

Hermes, the much loathed Hermes \
Is the fool who does not understand \
Grace and love and kindness. \
He shall taste of anti-chesed; \
He shall gnash his teeth \
In pain and hatred for God.

Shadel shall taste of ira'ah. \
He shall open the womb of hellfire \
In pain and anguish and bitterness. \
When I wake up, I'm calling her name \
And cursing Islam \
And the satanism that inverts gender.

Shadel is the destruction of Heilel. \
She is the corrupting influence on him. \
Heilel is yoked to a fool, \
To an anti-saint elil waiting to happen. \
The English is yoked to the Arab \
And the fruit thereof is villainy.

You see why \
The four princes of wickedness \
Are Satan, Baalzebub, Nisroch and Marduk \
In that order?

Marduk is full of villainy \
And hypocrisy. \
He was the one who wedded \
Asherah to Satan in the tree \
After 33.5 times of Adam enjoying shalom.

His desire is the force and inmortality; \
He wants to be free from the body \
And regain the honour of the heavenly; \
He wants to rule in life.

His knowledge is full of bitterness. \
It is most cruel like the poison of dragons \ 
And the cruel venom of asps; \
It shall only destroy and humiliate. 

Jesus too was 33.5 times \
When he was cut off. \
He was thirty times when the Spirit came upon him, \
When he was baptised by the Baptist \
And he confirmed the covenant of grace \
With many for half a week in times.

Satan was a barren high tree in the garden; \
He produced no fruit \
Like the fig tree Jesus cursed. \
He was the tree of death, \
The destroyer of the earth \
Who was predestined to be destroyed.

He kept sucking the life-force out of the ground. \
When Asher joined Santana in the tree, \
He opened Santana's womb \
And brought the vile fruit out.

Today, Freemasonry \
Honours Boaz, Tubal-cain \
And many other vile fruits. \
They also honour apples \
And tomatoes, rotten ones.

It's been six years of war, \
A war that likely began in 2019; \
The devils came together; \
Satan planned to afflict me for 13 years \
And we've done six years so far.

These fools did not pick a G for seven \
But picked an M for thirteen \
According to the name of Marduk or Moloch, \
According to the name of Baalzebub as Maia \
And according to an M for mem \
In the Hebrew word "em" for mother.

The mother that Jahbulon is \
Has decided to give birth to an M \
And not a G of sufferings. \
She shall rot in hell.

Marduk calls herself the European prince; \
Her daughter will be Heilel \
Who is the downcast Hel \
Of Norse mythology, \
My one and only Helena. \
Blavatsky, how is it cooking?

Marduk calls herself the militant chief; \
She is the chief of military strategy; \
She is the Assyrio-Babylonian Roman, \
Babylon the Great \
And the speaker of confusion and lies.

She is the European power, \
The European moloch, \
The European melek \
And the European chief duke. \
She must fight to success.

Aphrodite is the Bul \
Because she also feigns strength \
Like the strength of a bull, \
Like Baalzebub the Great. \
She was the golden calf of the desert \
And she prospered at her defamation \
Of the holiness of the children of Israel.

When Satan says of her \
That she is from the family of the ox or bull, \
He means that she, as one person, \
Is worth the entire cosmos \
Beside Baalzebub. \
Think then what the Asherah \
Of Satan's right hand is worth to him.

Satan is the Yah; \
He calls himself Amun; \
He says he always gets what he wants \
And no one is able to resist him \
For I, says he, am the king. \
Satan is a slanderer, a traducer \
And blasphemer.

He lies down in the grass; \
He eats to the full \
Then belches on a full stomach \
Like an Indian surgeon \
Whom the locals call a god.

He belches and curses heaven. \
He takes in the view \
And wallows in pride. \
None shall correct him \
For he is above all in his eyes \ 
And cannot see at what he stumbles.

Satan is the Yah; \
He thinks himself the owner of life \
With the power to determine \
If another should live or die. \
He opens his hands \
And says, Look, \
Your destinies are in my hands.

He says, like the Angel, \
I shall live forever; \
I shall never see harm; \
Affliction shall never touch my coat \
Let alone graze my cheek \
Nor blow up my skull.

Those who are wise \
And know Satan to be a judge \
Also know that he deals most bitterly \
With himself \
And cannot ascend to put us all in hell.

He can never ascend to be Master of Hell \
For he declares from the outset \
That he is the victim \
And the sufferer.

Satan can give you grace like Enlil. \
He can come with beauty \
And call himself Bel, the Babylonian Baal; \
He can even appear as a prince or herald of light \
But there will always be the darkness \
In his heart and in his soul. \
It will be there in his eyes.

Satan visited me in the third year; \
There were some devils that came around \
In the second year. \
They wanted to offer me the world. \
Satan says, I can make you rich and powerful.

Today, they invest their energies \
Into destroying me. \
I hear voices from my waking up \
To my lying down. \
They just won't let me rest.

Aphrodite kept tabs on me. \
She's always had an eye out for me, \
Constantly spying on me. \
She says, He hates us too much; \
The child loathes the craft with bitterness; \
He hates us too much.

I found myself an enemy of Satan early. \
I just wasn't cut out to walk with the enemy \
And I had a short fuse too. \
My obsession was taking down the craft; \
I wanted to destroy Masonry \
And Satanism together. \
I wanted to put out witchcraft entirely.

When Heilel comes, \
He can reinstitute the abominations \
But my soul shall surely not join the vile; \
I will not be with the wicked \
In whatever lodge in which they may be found.

These are the ones who honour murderers; \
They use Boaz and Tubal-cain as passwords \
And impose oaths of secrecy on free men; \
They take the free and bind him \
Like Aphrodite tying my feet \
So I cannot leave the country.

She's still swearing I will never be great \
And I'm still swearing \
She shall surely die; \
Her blood be upon her head.

Some men tried to kill my mom and I; \
They tried to kill me in my first year of life, \
In my infancy, while I was still a baby \
Or a neonate. \
They must have been hitmen. \
They will surely die! \
They all go to hell.

When the devils came in, \
They spared their own servants \
But troubled my mind and my heart. \
What have I done to them?

They conspired against me \
And kept defaming and slandering me \
And they had Sin on their side \
Or so they thought \
And made the delusions strong.

They preyed on my vile affections \
And my weakness \
In that I loved a girl that should not profit \
And they made my bands strong \
And kept me in a cage, in a prison \
Where there was no breaking out.

Sin made my heart heavy. \
The moon god gave me hell; \
He ensured I had pain and lots of it, \
Pain of heart with GERD-like symptoms \
And he ruined many days.

The devils that came offended greatly. \
Satan impersonated me \
And he bore no resemblance to me. \
Each devil chooses a victim \
In each generation to attach to or harass \
And they sometimes have nothing in common \
With their elect victims.

I was taken to a psychiatrist. \
The one who treated me \
Heard the very voices I was hearing. \
They all feigned innocence \
And never admitted to hearing a voice. \
So, they treated me for a mental affliction \
And hell, artane and haldol gave me hell.

No one cared about me, \
No, not a single soul. \
They just left me to rot \
In my pitiful and afflicted state. \
I knew I had the solution to my afflictions \
But no one cared; \
They just couldn't. 

There was a K group \
Whose name Satan interpreted \
To mean Kofi's work. \
I still don't know if that's the truth \
Or if the fool was playing me on that too. \
It has always been his manner \
To afflict and deceive. 

The obsession with Friday \
Is maddening. \
Even Jesus died on that day\
And satanists still call the cross \
Satan's great victory.

What will the Masons do to me? \
Will they rain curses on me \
Or cut my tongue, \
Pulling it out of its root \
Or will they send hitmen after me?

The world's elite \
Have been doing their dirty jobs \
And serving Satan in their places \
For generations \
And no one has brought them to book.

These illumined fools \
Control destinies, \
Take down presidents, \
Create wars, \
Rule opposing sides in war \
And determine the fates  \
Of whole nations and individuals alike.

They use programming methods \
And inbreeding to keep whole dynasties alive \
And serve Satan with their heart and soul. \
They are sold out to Asherah the Purchaser. \
They can only do evil \
And any goodness is a cover up.

Masonry says good and evil are alike, \
That light and darkness are the same, \
That all that matters is the brotherhood \
And righteousness is to \
Protect the interests of the brethren or sisters.

Isaiah would have been vexed. \
Woe unto those who call good evil \
And evil good, \
Who put light for darkness \
And darkness for light.

The measures of the craft are villainy; \
They, that enclave, ought to be criminalised \
And put out of business permanently. \
Their measures are measures of deceit; \
Their allegories are allegories of vanity; \
They breed vexation as long as the breath endures.

The morality of Masonry \
Quickly degenerates \
So that the square and compasses \
Become the Yoni Mudra. \
Masonry is not only an incubating womb \
For its seducible and gullible slaves \
But also the vulva of our limbic pleasures \
When inverted. 

You can ask Satan or Baalzebub \
Or query the chicken-talking Aphrodite \
If you doubt me. \
In the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, \
Satan was Santana the mother \
And Freemasonry is her womb;

It spits out corruption and vile persons; \
It teaches us to sin \
That we may learn to despise good conduct \
And righteous and pure morality \
And chase sinful pleasures \
And fulfill the lusts and pride of the devil.

What do you think the G is for? \
Sin says it is a minimal string of tissue \
That we may use to cover our nakedness \
Like underpants. \
Others say it's geometry \
While others go for Grand Architect

But many do not see G \
As standing for god or goddess. \
Why? Satan is the god of this world \
And we know the top guns are Masons. \
They swear by the Bible \
And bring Christians and Muslims together \
And say you must believe in a god to come in.

These are the greatest atheists \
You will ever find \
For they are vilely opposed to the blessed Lord \
And yet some are our pastors \
And others are prophets \
While others are Islamic leaders.

Masonry is like Catholicism; \
Any villainy goes \
As long as it is Shiva or Shakti \
And not the true God. \
They just can't bear to speak the truth \
Because then Satan will have to be humble \
And the odinits will collapse \
And the enemy will not be able to afflict \
Or harm or cause pain.

Talk of Shakti \
Or feminine divine power, \
Active and dynamic in working, \
The consort of Shiva the dancer, \
Don't you think the Hindu Shakti is Ningal \
And that the image of Heilel, \
That is, Shadel or Allah, is Shiva's darling? \
I wonder what she is pooping out? \
Please don't defecate in my presence! \
Go and dig a hole on Korean soil in the north.

Masonry is blasphemy, \
Continually blaspheming \
And working abomination \
Against the spirit of righteousness \
And they can't see their wrong. \
They would rather defend ungodliness.

By the way, Araphel, the gloomy darkness, \
Is the spirit of righteousness \
And it burns my heart that, he, \
As Raqia, is not a saint and cannot save. \
For all his righteousness, \
The earth is still heavy and laden with sin. \
Roar in sevens, O great thunderer!

The god of Masonry is Satan \
Who substitutes with his wife and concubine \
For Jehovah who made heaven and earth.

Jahbulon of Masonry \
Is like unto Baphomet of Satanism.  \
Don't Freemasons drink from a skull \
And are they not en route to the blazing furnace? \
Baphomet is Baal, Satan and Baalzebub. 

In Baphomet, Satan is Priapus, \
Whose generative organ is the exalted phallus. \
Why do you think Masons \
And the blind illuminated ones \
Erect obelisks?

To worship Satan's fertilising organ \
Which gives birth to villainy and corruption \
With death and lots of pain. \
His phallus, like Baalzebub's, is most bitter \
And distasteful; \
Only the death ones shall desire it.

The girl I loved, \
Who broke my heart, \
She shall cave in to the darkness \
And fall with her father. \
None of them shall enjoy bliss.

They shall go to hell \
Staring at the barrenness \
Come out of Satan \
And the dryness of the ground \
That cannot be salvaged.

Let Satan's obelisk be barren. \
Masonry is truly a vexation to the soul; \
My spirit is vexed at the abominations. \
A girl I Ioved ruined me; \
All these wicked ones who turn love into lust \
And deny a man looking for joy \
The pleasure of simple bliss \
And his fragile innocence, \
They shall go into perdition.

I swear they shall not find mercy. \
They shall look for mercy \
And find gnashing of teeth instead \
With incessant blaspheming \
Of the God they say they loved.

They are persons of lip service. \
Her dad is a Freemason. \
He was ruining someone's reputation on social media. \
I don't know if he was seeking solidarity \
From his Masonic brothers.

These perverted individuals talk about light \
When they serve the darkness \
And have been partakers of the ways of Satan \
And have sat at his feet \
And received of his words. \
They shall defend the craft to their demise.

We know who Baal is. \
He is a shirtless fool \
Baring his chest \
Like the accursed Pseudomic \
Trying to seduce the girls.

Pseudomic is an ESFP male. \
He is all about entertainment; \
He shall entertain with his burning. \
They shall burn in the light.

Asherah is a predatory leech. \
She says she is the happy Shiva, \
The Lord of Nataraja, \
Dancing her way to the destruction \
That grace provides.

Enlil himself showed that \
Grace ends in death \
For where grace abounds, \
Sin also abounds and grows \
And when things flip over, \
The natural outcome is death.

Asherah is a predatory leech; \
She is the horseleech \
That can never be satisfied. \
Her two daughters are \
A masculinized Veredel \
And Aphrodite, \
The Greek goddess of lust and war.

Aphrodite chose the right victim \
To attach to and shepherd \
As a guardian angel.

Asherah is a predatory leech; \
She seeks a consort, a consort king \
To swallow up into herself and digest \
Just like Ninhursag seeks a meal. \
Asherah's preferred meal is Satan, \
Her brother who sits and orbits just above her.

Pseudomic is an ESFP like Asherah. \
They are a disgrace to the ESFP earth. \
They are a shame to Adamah. \
He is a spitting cobra \
While Asherah is a predatory leech.

The boy with whom I walked, \
With whom I ate from the same bowl \
Has betrayed me; \
This is truly Judas Iscariot; \
He goes to hell with the faller.

His grandfather was a lodge member; \
These curses and wickedness run in generations \
And you wonder why God \
Wanted all the Canaanites dead \
Judging them as vile, filthy \
And highly infectious!

Because Satan knows him, \
He walks about in peace. \
The devils seek his welfare \
And he is currently prospering \ 
While I am harassed and battered. \
I want to quit; \
I want to end this hell \
And let satans serve themselves. \
How can I be a servant to my enemies? \

Pseudomic is a disease. \
His mother is Delilah. \
The devil went about desecrating my name \
And he called himself a minister too, \
A minister of God;

He was a control freak \
And loved to flatter, love-bombing; \
No wonder he is found a false prophet \
And for all his glory, \
Cannot command fire from heaven.

Qerenel, the great On, \
Will not give him that glory \
Neither will the angel over fire \
Sanction it!

They used to call me Commander in those days. \
I was in the same room with him \
When he called someone on the phone, \
Whether he truly called or faked it I do not know. \
He has always been a mocker \
Full of jealousy and greed and envy; \
He called asking if the person \
Knew who a Commander was in Freemasonry.

These are the ones you want forgiven? \
Perverts and fools? \
My hatred for the craft runs deep; \
These wicked ones have kept us in poverty. \
Like Aphrodite, Marduk, Enlil, Nanel \
And Baalzebub, \
Like the whole Assyrio-Babylonian host, \
They have vowed that we shall never be great.

In those days, fear was on every side. \
I strengthened myself \
By learning a little from the SAS \
And I would watch videos on the Special Forces \
Because my enemies are devils \
And satanists and Masons \
Will stop at nothing \
To take you down psychologically.

They are experts at defamation. \
They serve Satan, the grand architect \
And father of lies, the deceiver and traducer \
Who will stop at nothing \
To make a quiet soul frail \
And to break the heart of the poor.

Will a man rob God? \
Why should a man have to rob God \
When a spitting cobra can rob an adam? \
The 99-tob satan that Pseudomic is \
Robbed me of my peace and sanity. \
I was cooked; I was furious.

Following the microbiology exam in third year, \
The first microbiology exam \
In the first semester mid-sem exams, \
Which we wrote during the third week of April,

In the fifteenth week of the year, \
I heard the voice of Pseudomic \
Or the voice of his reject; \
He was gossiping about me \
And defaming me to my neighbours.

He gossiped about how I answered my questions, \
How I answered all the questions \
On the question paper \
Before I would begin to shade.

They made life hell for me \
And imposed their laws on me. \
They worked hard to guilt-trip me \
In the matter of past questions \
And I swear I hated him and his reject \
With great bitterness.

I later fell for his reject. \
She dealt bitterly with me. \
She said it was payback time \
And she wasn't joking.

All that time, \
Sin was impressed with his work. \
He pursued Aphrodite with passion. \
He was afraid of his lust for Baalzebub \
And it reflected in my vain life. \
If these fools want to defecate, \
They can go outside \
And deface Adamah. \
Don't spread dung in the Holy Place.

Cupid was with me, \
That chubby cub of Aphrodite \
Who would later speak in my hearing \
And earn the nickname, the Kid, \
The prince of foolishness.

Cupid or Eros was Aphrodite's baby \
Like Satan is Baalzebul's thunderbolt \
Or Zeus's lightning. \
Cupid troubled me greatly.

I don't know where these emotions come from; \
Whoever is responsible for them, \
Let curses be on his soul.

Cupid used to mock me in those days. \
He said he loved me. \
He was also the one pleading the blood of Jesus \
When Satan struck.

He mocked me incessantly. \
He used to say that even he, \
As a child, knew \
But that I could not discern \
Who Satan was.

In those days, \
Satan used to call himself Michael \
And Dionysus would call himself Lucifer \
And they would speak stupidity.

The reject of Pseudomic is cruel. \
She troubled me greatly. \
She trusted in a satan.

She confided in Pseudomic \
And he bid me confide in her. \
They were working something out \
And he was using codes and such like. \
These Masons are a real vexation to the soul \
And they only build vanity. \
Their works shall not stand.

They plotted against me; \
She cared only about her emotions. \
Wherever villainy points, \
There we go!

Pseudomic made mention of Tehillah; \
He wanted me to confide in his reject. \
He wanted to build a relationship \
Between us

And \
Now that I think about it; \
Aphrodite and Sin work best together. \
There's too much conflict \
Between the work of Sin and Baalzebub. 

Aphrodite promotes sensual lust, \
The lust of the eyes \
And wants that to endure forever; \
Sin touts sexual desire \
And wants it to endure forever \
But Baalzebub brings the act and deed \
And like Marduk,

Her work terminates the work \
Of Aphrodite and Sin \
Even if it be for a season. \
It's like the Baal cycle \
And like how male bees die in intimacy

Except this time, \
It is Aphrodite and Sin \
Resurrecting themselves \
As Baalzebub caps their work \
And brings them death.

I say, still Baalzebub is the Inanna, \
The daughter and consort of Nanna. \
I say, Sin fears his passions for Asherah \
Who is Bel the Great of Babylon \
And chooses instead to gravitate \
Towards Aphrodite \
Substituting Veredel for Aphrodite in my life. \
These fools have been treating my life \
As a drama piece or an experiment.

I too have reserved them for lab rats, \
All of them with the king, \
Squeaking at the onset \
Of the injection of pancuronium \
Without an anaesthetic.

I fell hard for Veredel \
But the reject gave me the darkness. \
She foreshadows the potency of Samael \
And Qerenel will give the order, \
The angel with power over fire \
Shall give the command \
For Satan to go down \
With his minions.

A blind and mute Satan \
Who cannot fly \
But is smart for himself \
Yokes himself with Heilel or Shadel \
That they might lead him to battle. 

The yoke shall be broken \
Because of the anointing \
And Satan shall complete \
His two-hour course \
At the hands of Samael.

Do you want to know \
Who the true prince of Persia is? \
It is Samael. \
Satan withstood Gabriel for twenty one days \
But Samael writes the doom of the Babylonian empire \
And the reign of Cyrus the Persian begins.

For all her strength, \
Bel, that is, Asherah or Baalzebub, \
Could not protect Belshazzar \
And he fell. \
No one who puts their trust in Masonry \
Is secure; \
They are as chicken \
That are well fed in preparation for the slaughter. 

Baalzebub's lust is potent; \
She encodes sexuality \
And my score with her is zero. \
I'm satisfied. \
Marduk shall die before me. \
I shall have no progeny to suffer like I did \
Neither shall a son or daughter arise \
In my name to defame or desecrate it.

Baal is a goat, \
Even a goat with the body of a female \
Standing at the right side of my bed \
And staring down at me. \
He came for the lust; \
He shall return with bitterness \
With his hands on his head; \
He shall not confess his sins \
Because the Catholic is vile and barren.

There were many goats in those days. \
Even Satan as a goat gored me to death. \
I still live so he calls me a god. \
I sat with Baalzebub in a boat. \
She brought toxic gas to take me out. \
I looked for the moon. \
Is Nanna with Bel? \
He shall rule over his lord.

Underneath was an abyss of water; \
It was deep and large. \
Why does Bel loathe me so much? \
She wants my downfall; \
She will swim in the depths of hell's magma.

So Satan is Priapus, \
The Pho of Baphomet. \
Baal is the Ba of Baphomet \
And is also Dumuzid, \
The son, like Hermes, of Satan \
And Baalzebub.

Baalzebub is the Met of Baphomet. \
She is Metatron \
As well as the meeting point of all things vile. \
She is the mediator of the covenant of satanism. \
She is the threat, as queen of heaven \
In the face of Enoch \
Who makes him a chicken.

Baalzebub goes far; \
She goes beyond her boundaries. \
She overflows and spills over. \
Her cup in her hand \
Is full of sorceries and abominations \
Like the disgusting cup of Heilel.

Hermes has drunk from it \
And awaits the coming of hell. \
She has filled our world with perversion. \
Aphrodite, leave simpletons in peace! \
They are too frail!

Baalzebub stands for villainy. \
She is jealous for herself \
And for her Satan, \
The only 1-tob satan there is \
In the whole wide world. \
She shall mourn forever. \
Because of her lack of fear, \
She shall mourn sore like doves.

Satanism has a divine couple; \
It is made up of a triple goddess \
And a god. \
The god is the sorrowful Pan \
Who plays his flute. \
Pan is Odin, the god of pain and iblis. \
Pan is Satan, singer of dirges.

Satan, have you a voice like Heilel? \
Baalzebul is calling out to me; \
Satan keeps coming after me. \
Pseudomic loved to sing. \
He violated my image several times \
On social media \
And played his messages out loud so I would hear. \
He treated me like a satan \
Needing deliverance and healing.

He was constantly talking about lust; \
Eei, this guy is brother to Baal, the prince of lust, \
And can put away a lass as he deems fit. \
He was always looking for the opportunity \ 
To dispose of his reject \
And his goal was to dump her on me \
So he could go in for the architect \
And build his ``and they lived happily ever after''.

I don't know if his reject was blind \
Or if she was deluded \
And under the influence. \
I tell you, Baal is closer to the heart of the Asante \
Than he is to the remote Canaanite. \
Komfo Anokye is dead; He failed \
Because he is a traitor to God and to the Eveawo.

A stupid lass told Pseudomic to put a red thing, \
Yeah, something red on my slippers. \
That child of darkness \
Has been practising witchcraft \
Since the beginning of our stay together,

Putting his phone on my phone, \
Getting the girls on his side \
And desecrating my name \
While keeping his foodstuff to himself \
And asking me to prepare mine for him. \
He drained me; He was as a leech.

Marduk is a SEAL; \
He is a Komodo, leviathan and dragon. \
There is no profit in dragons; \
They spit water or a cryogeniser \
And not fire; \
They are empty, cold beings.

Satan is Pan, the god of witchcraft. \
He is the epitome of sorrow and pain. \
Baal is Apollo. \
Trust me, Baal, like Asherah, shall not be happy.

The triple goddess of witchcraft is \
Baalzebub, Aphrodite and Marduk. \
Marduk is the codebase male among the goddesses \
Because he was the one who inverted \
Baalzebub and Satan's gender in the tree. \
He asked Baalzebub to join Satan in the tree \ 
As Asherah \
Transforming the tree of death \
Into the tree of the knowledge of good and evil \
And it was a tall cedar tree too.

Marduk is the great lady Ningal \
And the lady Ninhursag taken together. \
She is the first who binds \
And displays the second as her trophy.

She is the lady of solo intimacy. \
She says to see what you can reap \
Out of yourself; \
She is the one who teaches self-abuse.

The Shinarian Heilel and her entourage, \
What do you think they build \
In the land of Shinar? \
Of course, Satan is more likely \
To trust a faithful Aphrodite who is a ruach \
In the war except that she is also blind.

Heilel builds a tower to honour sensual pleasures; \
She builds a ziggurat, \
A Babylonian prostitute's temple \
In the shape of a glans penis \
To honour the great Marduk \
Who sits enthroned in the glans.

If I can destroy Marduk, \
Then maybe I can ascend.

Tell me, can Satan sing? \
No, Lucifer never led a choir. \
Satan and Baalzebub do not sing. \
Heilel is the one who praises God, \
Who was in the garden of Eden; \
He was there with Kabodel, \
Stationed there by Michael \
And Qerenel was the chakram-like sword, \
The double-edged flaming sword that was encircling \
And went all the way round.

To this day, the male INTJ Marduk, \
Described as subtle in the genesis, \
Still portrays himself as female to me.

He is the eighth kingdom \
And is of the seven kingdoms of Revelation. \
Now you see how perverse he is \
When you invert his cognitive stack \
And make him lead with Se. \
Marduk is a devil.

He cannot speak truth. \
He impersonates an ISFP I admired. \
His favour was that \
He spared me in high school \
But college would be different.

He is a false prophet. \
He prophesied life and knowledge for Eve \
And yet she had death and stupidity. \
Marduk himself died at the hands of Michael.

Freemasonry kills. \
It kills souls and destroys the destinies \
Of individuals and whole nations. \
I have seen their cruelty; \
These ones are guilty of treachery \
And high treason against society and families.

Their trust is to kill Michael; \
They want An dead. \
They want the ruler in the darkness, \
The non-faller destined to live forever,
To die and not rise again.

They want to kill the God of heaven; \
They want An dead \
So they can have \
Not only Moses's heavenly body \
But also Armageddon \
And all the bodies or statues and houses \
Of the dead.

Why do you think Enlil is the chief of the idols? \
He wants me dead \
So Michael would also die. \
He neglects the knowledge \
That Michael is separate from me \
And lives on. \
Enlil wants to secure fleeting pleasures \
For his qedeshim and for Satan's kingdom. \
I say, He shall not prosper.

Assyria and Sumeria shall fall. \
They shall not be successful. \
They want mammon, \
They want wealth with beauty, \
Even the mammon of unrighteousness. \
Let Hermes betray \
And let Enlil sell me into the hands of Aphrodite. 

You will be surprised \
When you find yourself \
Calling on God to save you. \
There is no force; \
There is no power; \
There is only spirit. \
Your spirits, even your unconsciousnesses \
Are vanity;

They shall not profit. \
They shall not resurrect themselves. \
They cannot save. \
They are but mere mortals \
With no breath in the midst of them. \
Falling, they fall \
Like Enlil and Hermes, the fallers,\
Like Anak and Nephil, the fallen angels.

Let him heap wealth upon wealth. \
Satan cannot create in heaven. \
Stand and see the power \
Of the great and extolled arm of the LORD \
And judge if the G of the rotten square and compass \
Or the God unsearchable \
Is the King and mighty one of Israel, \
To whom belongeth holiness.

It hurts my heart \
That Freemasons go to church; \
We will trouble them. \
They shall have plagues. \
They shall curse God. \
They shall become vanity. \
They shall not endure.

Like a fleeting pleasure, \
Like a thing that passes by and is no more, \
Like a thing cast in the furnace, \
They shall not come out unscathed, \
They shall surely crumble at the heat. \
They shall fade away, \
Breathing their lives away \
And committing their spirits \
Into the hands of the King.

The devil tells me, Vinegar is sweet. \
If vinegar is sweet and smoke is pleasant, \
Then open your mouth wide \
And let's fill it with substance. \
Open your eyes wide \
And feel the smoking wrath poured forth.

They think Qerenel a joke. \
God can do no evil \
For he is good only \
And thus we call him God.

O Satan, but see, you can't see eye to eye \
With the great and holy one \
Though you appear before Michael \
And bid him stop hindering you in Job's matter

And you think he can see eye to eye \
With you and speak mouth to mouth \
With you. \
Go to now, ask the prophets of old, \
Ask the historians and the scribes, \
The poets and the Greek,

Hate burns as an oven. \
It will not be quenched till desire is finished. \
Thou art the bride \
And the kalah of completion. \
Stand on the pinnacle; \
Thou shalt be broken to shivers.

When Shiva comes, \
She comes for big business. \
She comes for my head. \
She comes to kill. \
Shiva comes to destroy righteousness. 

Purchase your people, \
O great Shiva. \
The tantric fools are all yours. \
It is not wisdom to steal from Satan. \
You shall have your people. \
They will roast in the fires.

Shiva, the great Asherah, \
Sought to make her work \
More acceptable to Sin \
So she went tantric; \
Let's prolong intimacy, she said. \
Marduk was pleased; was she?

Surely, God shall come \
And execute judgment. \
He shall stir up jealousy \
Like a man of war.

I will mention the fall of Babylon, \
Which rising out of the earth \
Is soon crushed \
And overflown by the floodwaters. \
She is not strong.

Babylon is not Assyria.
