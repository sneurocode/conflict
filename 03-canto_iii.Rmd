# God

Save me, O God, from delusion; \
Redeem me from the hand of Marduk \
And do not let the wicked rule over me; \
Do not let us see eye to eye.

Save me, O God, from the wicked \
For I have waited for thy salvation, \
From the cruel wolf, the dragons, \
The cow and the viper. \
Save me from the jawed leech.

In your splendour, save \
And in your beauty \
That we might praise thee \
As long as the sun and moon endure.

My God has to be honourable, \
The most honourable, \
Exalted, exalted above all. \
He has to be the King, \
The prince of the kings of the earth.

He has to be a gibor, \
A mighty warrior \
Commanding strength in the fields \
And crushing the skulls of rebels.

My God has to be perfect, \
Perfect in holiness, \
A just God and upright, \
Without iniquity and sin.

He shall endure as long as Zion \
And rule to the bounds of time. \
He shall suck of the abundance of the seas \
And grace and great glory \
Shall be his oil from day to day.

There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun, \
Who passing through the garden, \
Takes Marduk by the horns \
And skins him alive \
And clothes Adam and Eve with his scaly hide.

The everlasting God is with me \
For a sure defence and a mighty fortress \
And he shall rule over the strong \
And be praised by the mighty \
And there shall we see \
The jealous and silly one \
Slain by her imperishable envy.

O God, when thou didst lay \
The foundations of the earth, \
The morning stars were there, \
The four time entities — \
Shachar, Mishchar, Araphel and Qerenel — \
Sang together in perfect melody. \
They were the first musicians in history.

Thou didst create the earth on the first day \
And Adamah remained among the maim; \
She remained as a tob among the tobs. \
On the first day, you made Mammon \
And you made Armageddon. \
You made the ras, the outer darkness.

On the second day, you made the mansions, \
The inanimates to house the angels \
And on the third day, you finished heaven, \
You finished your creative work in the celestial space. \
On the third day, you made the angels,

Even on the same day \
You laid the foundations of the earth; \
On the same day you gave Adamah her body.

Satan saw your work and was jealous; \
His heart smote him in the chest. \
There was vexation in Satan's heart \
And envy and jealousy in Baalzebub's \
And they sought to overthrow creation.

Say, was it not Baalzebub herself \
Who said wrath and vexation \
Killeth the foolish man \
And that envy slayeth the silly one? \
Who is the foolish man? \
Is it not Satan? \
And is not Baalzebub the deluded one?

Baalzebub, O, how hated you are! \
She is smitten to the full \
By the blows of Sin; \
She is full of delusions \
And would have desired \
To lead the rebellion \
In the War of the Purge.

She says, I am \
And there is no one else. \
She is the angel of Satan \
And the Purchaser whose image provokes to jealousy \
Yet she exalts herself above Satan \
And makes herself the father of the fall \
So that Satan as the effeminate Santana \
Might lie beneath her.

Baalzebub calls herself Asherah, \
The one who shall never be widowed \
And who shall never see the loss of children \
Because she has purposed \
She shall never be married \
And shall never give birth. 

She brags about her strength \
And calls herself On. \
She swears by her lustful strength; \
I am stronger than Satan, she declares.

Baalzebub is hell-bent; \
She came for the kill; \
She has no plan; \
Her end goal is my demise \
And the death of Michael. \
She wants Armageddon.

She says, If any must sing, \
They must sing to me. \
Have you ever heard Asherah singing? \
She is too deluded \
And filled full with delusions of grandiosity \
Like a haughty and wanton Jewish lady \
With her nose held up high in the air \
Who walks about making noises \
With her ornaments and declares to all her riches.

Baalzebub calls herself the queen of heaven. \
She says, I am the lady of kingdoms; \
I give grain and bread \
And they bake cakes unto me \
And I provide rain in his season.

She sits and slanders her own mother's son; \
She opens her mouth to slander the son of Mishchar. \
She slanders Michael like she does my name; \
She has torn my honour into shreds.

I will be sown in dishonour \
And raised up in honour; \
Shame and disgrace shall not rob me \
Of my glory and promised peace. \
Surely, Baalzebub shall fade away \
Like a menstrous cloth that women cast away.

Satan was a sinner from the womb \
Like Marduk and Baalzebub his siblings \
But he thought, like Joker, \
He could deceive others \
And get away with a laugh.

Baalzebub is very bold; \
Her boldness arose from her delusion; \
She fell hard into Sin's ditch. \
Satan is the deceiver \
But Baalzebub is the antichrist.

She hates the Christ; \
She hates Michael and the elim \
And she declares it boldly \
In the gathering of elohim \
And before the hosts.

So who is the antichrist? \
Baalzebub is the first antichrist; \
She is before Heilel in villainy; \
Baalzebub is an ESFP female \
But Heilel is an INTP male;

The antichrist must be a female; \
Heilel shall be a female \
And earn the dishonour of perversion; \
She shall lie with and defile herself \
With kings even to hell.

She and Baalzebub \
Are the Jezebelian Babylonian mother \
Who rides the dragon. \
They shall drink blood to drunkenness. \
Baalzebub, thou art doomed \
And destined for darkness;

Prepare blindness for her \
And make her dumb; \
Thou art no star; \
Thou shalt not give light; \
This iron shall not profit; \
Isis and Ishtar are dead. \
They are in the realm of the dead.

When Baalzebub came to me, \
She feigned love; \
She impersonated one I had fallen for; \
She impersonated the reject of Pseudomic; \
She had her cold icy hands on me;

She made my paths deep and slippery; \
She led me towards hell; \
She meant to procure me unto Satan or death; \
She sought my grave demise.

She appeared around the time of the exams \
When I was going to write \
My first end of year theory exam \
In fourth year; \
That was in July!

She was there \
When I was writing \
My Chemical Pathology paper, \
When I was preparing \
For my Chem Path viva \
And when I was studying \
For my Sys Path viva.

She was there in the room \
We went to wait in \
As we waited for our turn \ 
For the Sys Path viva

And the reject was there too,\
The one who was musing \
On the nature of these voices \
And wondering if they were ghosts.

Is Baalzebub your ghost \
From the grave, from the land of the dead?

So, Aphrodite and Cupid \
Handed over the baton to Baalzebub; \
Two to one, heh, \
While Satan remained a constant presence.

Baalzebub is screaming \
And an accursed Aphrodite jumps in; \
Satan is calling and trying to distract; \
He wants my attention; \
They are consumed with folly.

O God, when you lifted up your hands \
To heaven, to the shamaim, \
You swore by one who lives forever. \
You swore vengeance and retaliation. \
You will not forgive.

Surely, a recompense is in order; \
Let the enemies of God be confounded. \
Confounded be all they that serve graven images, \
That boast themselves in idols \
And strengthen themselves in sin.

Who is as wise as Satan? \
Who is as stupid and foolish as the devil? \
Seeing many things \
And hearing many things \
And knowing many things, \
Yet he cannot know nor understand.

Who would go before Michael \
And bid him grant him access to Job \
That he might harass and destroy him? \
Later, he desired Peter \
And to this day, satanists \ 
Wear St Peter's Cross as a venerated object.

Seek not unto vile idols \
That mutter and stutter. \
These idols are worthless. \
Even the great and honourable Rachel \
Desecrated the idols \
Of foolish Laban.

But you say, did she not die in childbirth \
For desecrating an elil \
And for profaning an abomination? \
O, mortal, do I not suffer \
Because I showed promise \
And hated the devil and his kingdom \
With bitter hate and vexation?

So, Satan fought against me \
And did that which has never before been done \
And has wreaked a devastation \
To go into the pages of history \
At the point of an iron pen;

He devastated me, \
He fought against me \
With his arsenals of slander \
And constant harassment \
And perverse desecration; \
His delusions were unleashed upon me.

I came down under multiple onslaughts; \
He said he would destroy me. \
He would make my remembrance to cease, \
To cease from under the heavens.

Marduk was with him. \
The abominable Enlil with Shadel. \
They conspired against me. \
They knew they were in for hell.

Concerning the vexations \
Which ye have done to me \
And the vile desecrations and desolations, \
Ye have not had the end in mind \
And will ye deal thus \
With such great cruelty?

Satan said I ought to be destroyed. \
I could not be admitted into his fold \
Because I could not keep \
The simple oath of secrecy. \
His problem, as was Baal's, \
Was that I liked writing \
And could not keep silent.

These fools do not know \
The awesome and stunning destructions \
That await them. \
Give Baalzebub anti-chesed \
That she might know what it really feels like \
To hate the great God with gnashing teeth \
And with bleeding blue gums.

Satan, you hate me \
But do you know how much I hate you? \
Do you read me? \
Do you copy? \
Do you know my innards?

When you impersonate me \
As does Sin, your brother, \
Do you have the future in mind \
And do you have all variables accounted for? \
Thou shalt lie down in sorrow! \
Prepare slaughter for Baalzebub.

Rachel shall live. \
Where is Baalzebub? \
Who killed Rachel? \
I do not know.

Rachel shall live. \
The ewe of God shall live.

Baalzebub, your birth pangs shall come. \
Thou art a gebereth, huh. \
Thy pain shall be bitter. \
It shall come upon the horseleech; \
Even cruel and wicked labour pains \
Shall come upon the ra'ah that you are.

I said to the devils, \
Do not put your trust in me \
Because I am your destruction. \
Cease the programming. \
I will give you the full satanism treatment. \
You shall be broken, all of you, \
Like the satanic mind-controlled slaves.

Do not worship Satan \
Because he will not profit. \
Seek not unto the sorceress and rebel. \
Do not put your trust in Ningal. \
Ninhursag shall not deliver. \
They are the perverts, the anti-saints \
Waiting to destroy you.

I will praise the Lord as long as I live; \
Let my bones sing the Lord's praise. \
Let todah boom everywhere. \
Wherever life does ring, \
Wherever the greens live on, \
Let voices of joy and rejoicing be heard.

Come and let us go into the house of God. \
There, we will write the praises of our God. \
There, we will sing to the name of God Most High \
Who alone doeth wondrous things, \
Even things past finding out

For surely thou art a God of judgment; \
Justice and judgment rests with thee. \
Thou shalt deal to them their portions, \
Each one according to their works

For thou wilt save the afflicted people; \
The Lord my God will enlighten the darkness. \
He shall reach forth the yad \
And his hands shall open to me in grace \
And lift me up from the dungeon,

From the dark dry pit of snakes \
Where are venomous snakes \
Waiting to strike at and bite Joseph, \
From the den, the horrible den \
Where are mighty lions \
Waiting to break Daniel's bones.

The Lord is my strength \
And the fortitude of my mind. \
Thou holdest me standing. \
You lift me up \
So that I do not slip and fall \
And you enlarge my steps under me.

He confounds the wise \
And takes away the glory of fools; \
He destroys the wealth of the wicked \
And at Qerenel's command, \
The deceiver and the host \
Are cast into the burning light, \
Paying for their sins \
In pains that cannot be fathomed.

Baalzebub sits still \
In the dust. \
The iron hastens to rust. \
Her strength is gone from her. \
There is no life left in her. \
I give her my pledge — \
Destruction is her reward; \
Destruction and dishonour unto her soul.

Has thou seen a widow before, \
A real one, one who has lost her soulmate? \
Bitterness, grave bitterness is Asherah's portion.

I will mention the lovingkindnesses of God \
Who gives me life and holds me up; \
Thou, O King, art Jeshurun \
And thou shalt not faint. \
You rule forever with a right sceptre.

I will dash Death in pieces. \
His stroke shall cease. \
I will smite him twice, \
In the outer parts \
And in the inward parts \
And he shall know that he hath offended \
And done very foolishly.

Next time, stand before me as man \
And call yourself God \
And ask me to believe in you \
And to hope in your mercy. \
You shall have death and sorrow.

Encamp round about Armageddon. \
Compass him about as about Jericho \
Yet ye shall fall; \
Ye shall not stand world without end. \
Ye shall surely perish \
For strong is the Lord God \
Who judges the sinners.

Give me goodness; \
Take not away from me righteousness; \
Never let me see want, \
No, not today, not tomorrow. \
Supply me daily with nourishment. \
Let me not pine away in my sins \
Neither let me waste away from want of vitality. 

The Lord who gives strength unto his people \
And brings righteousness as torrents \
And clothes with peace \
And gives hope and brings faith \
Will soon rebuke the slanderer. \
Lead the charge, O great God of the dawn!

O, Egypt, worship the King of Kings \
And pay homage to righteousness \
For the gods of Egypt shall not profit. \
Baalzebub shall not worship; \
She shall be mute. \
She is Isis.

Seth goes down. \
As lightning, he falls. \
He shall not rise up \
And the eye of Horus shall be blinded. \
Baal shall never see again.

When Baal appeared in my dreams \
As far back as I can remember — \
Then, I thought he was God — \
He called me Moses \
And I saw a man who looked stoic \
And was clad in a white long garment \
At about the age of sixty

Who passed in between two rows of people \
And was led to the slaughter; \
He walked on by himself \
And demonstrated no fear. \
Was he slaughtered? \
I didn't see the end of it!

Baal, Baal, he shot me in the head; \
Baal was in the confessional. \
I fear for the pastors of Ghana \
And for all prophets around the world; \
They destroy a lot of souls \
And can never be innocent.

O God, do they know thee? \
Do you know them? \
All these that prophesy in thy name, \
That swear by the king of heaven \
And forbid prayers to Michael \
But pray in the name of Jesus, \
Are they in thy books?

If Christ stands for praises and worship, \
If Christ wants there to be music, \
Even the sweet fragrance of the lifting up of hands \
Toward heaven and the opening of the mouth \
In praises and beautiful words,

Then Baalzebub, the antichrist \
Stands for the absence of music. \
She has been perverting all my music. \
Wherever I turn to on YouTube, \
This devil just won't let me or the music rest.

A man has got to be happy \
But Asherah is a killjoy \
And a parasite and plague. \
She is a blood-sucking horseleech \
And a cruel parasite in the cosmos.

She is an alternative Satan, \
The bringer of perversion, \
Sexual depravities and harassment \
Without peace and righteousness.

She shall destroy herself and many \
But Christ shall ransom my soul \
And deliver from the clutches of this hell. \
You will see in that day \
When bands are put on the devils \
And Hermes goes dumb.

Then, what will become of his brides. \
I am fed up of the lies of Hermes. \
Hermes is Ephraim. \
He is a Canaanite; \
He can only prostitute; \
He is a qadesh of Enlil.

Michael loved Hermes; \
He loved him while he was only a child \
But Jeshurun waxed fat and kicked. \
Thou art grown tall; \
Thou art waxen great.

Then, he forsook the God that cleansed him \
And lifted him from the mud, \
From eating swine's flesh \
And feasting on mud; \
He forsook God his father \
And went in to the queen;

He received commission from her hand. \
He betrayed his king \
And became the king of satanism. \
He became Satan the King, \
The ruler of the Brotherhood \
Replete with regional brides to defile.

I swear the law is looking for him. \
Araphel is calling for his destruction. \
Hermes compasses me about with lies, \
Ephraim compasses me about with lies, \
Declares a grieved Michael.

Hermes didn't quite get the memo. \
You certainly do not want to grieve the Holy Spirit \
With whom you have been sealed unto salvation.

Hermes despised his crown \
And cast it to the dogs. \
Do not cast your pearls before swine \
Lest they despise and disregard it \
And turn and rend you.

Judah is an eagle. \
Judah is really a bald eagle. \
He is a fisherman and fish-eater \
And Dagon and Eve are fishes. 

He goeth about preaching marriage. \
Judah is Gabriel. \
Gabriel, I want an armourbearer, an ezer \
Not a wife, not an ishshah.

Gabriel is still faithful  \
And rules with God. \
He shall ascend to become an el.

Gabriel troubled me \
With his prophecies. \
His prophecies messed up my life. \
I said this man lieth. \
Then, I understood — \
He spoke about Jesus and not me.

Give me peace; \
Where is the river \
Where all is still, \
By whose banks is calm?

Give me peace. \
What will you have? \
I have peace; give me peace. \
Give me peace; give me peace.

O God, you saw when Eve betrayed. \
She spoke to the Komodo. \
You saw when Marduk betrayed. \
You know the thoughts of their hearts \
And the things they have purposed; \
You know their inmost desires.

Give their desires to the wind; \
Let them eat grass. \
For the oppression \
And for the violence \
And for the onslaught, \
Let them gnaw their teeth for pain \
That they may know that the King \
Ruleth in heaven and earth.

So, Hermes shall be dumb. \
He shall be blind also \
Because he took not the log from his eye \
But sinned without remorse \
And there was no conscience \
To say, What am I doing?

He should not have departed \
From the glorious path; \
He should not have put his hand to the plough \
Then turned to look back \
Like Lot's wife did \
And gave the devil allowance \
To produce the abominable seeds of those two.

Grain is good \
And famine is a terror; \
Hermes, can you see into the future? \
Do you see the counsel of the Most High \
And can you perceive the decree gone forth? \
Dost thou know thy end \
And the bitterness thereof like that of Balaam?

Balaam shall not die the death of the righteous; \
He shall die the death of the uncircumcised, \
The death of the vile \
As of one reserved for the eternal darkness \
Whose light is crushed before the morning \
And consumed to the ends of the earth. 

Hermes, who gave Balaam counsel? \
Who is Baalpeor? \
Is she not the goddess of the opening, \
Thy mother that raised thee up \
And nurtured thee \
And taught thee the way of wisdom \
Which way is to violate women \
As a pervert that cannot be satisfied?

Hermes shall not see his brides anymore; \
He shall not behold the beauty of their forms \
Neither shall he speak to them \
To deceive them with soft words \
Only to return with three princes \
To tear the skin off the seducible.

You devils really hate humans, huh \
And you wonder what Satan was doing on earth \
As it is to this day. \
He is an idiot in toto.

Bread is good \
And manna is sweet; \
It is honey-crusted; \
Eat it to the full

And fill your bellies and delight yourselves \
In the abundance of the goodness of the land \
For the years of darkness shall be vile.

All that cometh, as saith the Preacher — \
That great Peniel, the enosh who strove with Jacob \
And called him a prince and Israel — \
Is vanity and vexation of spirit.

Peniel is a horse; \
His neck is clad with thunder. \
He is a geber \
And the angel who flies in the midst of heaven \
Having the everlasting gospel to preach \
To all creatures that are alive.

The message is simple: \
Fear God and obey his commands \
For he shall bring every work into judgment \
With every secret thing \
Whether it be good or evil.

Peniel is a horse; \
He smells the battle from afar off \
And laughs at the rattling quiver; \
He smiles at the sound of the alarms \
And trumpets and does not believe in fear.

I am dreaming of glory. \
Can there be peace, \
A little peace to each soul? \
There is no peace, saith the Lord, \
Unto the wicked.

Perchance, a little wisdom \
From time to time \
Shall make Baalzebub \
Feel like life is worth living. \
Some persons do become sober \
In their afflictions.

Do not get your hopes up. \
Baalzebub is a captive, a prisoner of war; \
She awaits death \
And shall surely not escape.

Enlil is gravely ashamed. \
He smashes his hands in anger \
At his foolishness \
And chases after more iniquity.

I shouldn't have been this cold, \
Even this icy cold as Death, he fumes. \
I will shut the mouth of my mind \
Because it troubles me that I live \
And my desires consumed me \
Therefore I sinned

For I sought Satan to please \
And feared and grieved my future \
And could not repent; \
Even Sin mocked me, \
A wolf parading as a lion.

Death, do you want to cross over, \
Even cross over into death? \
Thou hast suffered too much. \
Now, it's time to die. \
Baalzebub wants to be like the Most High. \
Heilel is dead;

My soul is inditing a good song; \
I want to peep into the first universe. \ 
My pen is awakening; \
The blue ink rouses itself up; \
The white sheet is before me. \
The tablet is prepared.

I want to know who God is. \
Who is the great Maker? \
Where is his place? \
Where does he reside? \
Why is he so exalted and yet so meek? \
Who is he?

He passes by on the right side; \
I turn the head but he is not there. \
He is swift on the left side \
Like Gabriel flashing out of the east \
Or like Michael or Fear running to battle \
And rising for the kill.

Has thou found him, \
The perfecter of righteousness, \
He who makes the mountains smoke, \
That calleth for the fire \
And the smoke \
And speaks with thunderings?

Love is at the apex \
Of the dimensions of God. \
God is love itself. \
He encodes energies of love; \
He encodes the knowledge of love \
With power and the desire \
To demonstrate his love.

He cannot be subject \
To the influences of Pleiades \
And he is bound to no one \
As seen in the demise of Heilel \
And the promotion of Yirel over Michael. \
But he enforces love.

Mishchar is the Gaboah King \
And, yes, there are many \
That are higher than Time and Gaboah. \
Hamalkah is the spirit of life, \
Peace and righteousness; \
Judge, O great one made of jasper: \
Am I a sinner? Is my folly wicked?

Mishchar loves On. \
He loves the epitome of strength. \
The gibor loves the geburah \
Who is the altar-table in his room \
And his lord.

The nephesh loves the ruach. \
The soul of the adam \
Is bound with strong cords of love \
To the soul of the cherub and air seraph.

You know Michael is Mishchar's son \
But do you know Mishchar loves Qerenel? \
The brilliant sunrise loves the tob. \
She has been his delight throughout eternity past. \
He is the Spirit and she is the bride; \
Gabriel certifies and seals their marriage \
And all of heaven rejoices \
At the marriage of these two morning stars.

Has thou found the Unfathomable \
That we may appear before him \
And bow down, pay homage and worship \
And open our treasuries \
And bring forth gold, frankincense and myrrh?

When the Lord appeared, \
The earth shook. \
The earth trembled in herself \
And quaked before God. \
She quaked with the noise of thunder \
And gave her voice from behind the King.

Adamah was beside herself with joy; \
She has long waited for the salvation, \
Even for the salvation of her God \
And of her King. \
She lies down and waits. \
Everyone shall receive of thy portion

For the Lord's lot is his people, \
The inheritance that he has purchased, \
Even ransomed from the anti-Source \
And from the anti-God, \
From the jaws of death, hell and sin.

Ain't it strange that God \
And the anti-Source \
Should have a common enemy \
And that her name should be Asherah?

Everyone that shall fall shall be replaced; \
Let no harm come to the number. \
Thou of thy goodness has furnished blessings \
For the poor of thy people.

So where does God dwell? \
No one knows \
For he is alone \
And there is none with him

Yet he has a home in the first dimension \
Where are three times infinity plus one, \
Yeah, even that many entities. \
There, God has a body of hardest diamond \
And is radiant white and shining.

God is a shining star, \
The father of lights, \
The Shachar \
With whom is no shadow of turning.

Of his own will \
He begat us \
That we may be a kind of firstfruits \
Of his creatures.

We were born of the blood of the Lamb. \
We were born in the sufferings of the King \
And he washed us clean in his blood \
And certified our redemption \
And said, Surely they are my children; \
I too will uphold them with my arm.

I long to see the power of God's salvation, \
To see his glory and power \
As the ancients did \
And were not dismayed.

They took hold of the ends of the earth \
And shook the wicked out of it. \
They broke the bones of the sinners \
And confounded the wise \
In their sorceries and charming.

I long to see the power of Christ, \
That resurrection power \
That never gives up and never fails. \
It is strong and sure,

More firm and trustworthy \
Than great Mount Zion which cannot be moved \
But abideth forever \
And sits exalted above Armageddon.

There on Zion, \
Yirel, Michael and the select stand \
And the congregation receives of their words \
And worships from the mount of assembly.

Give glory to the Unfathomable. \
I wrote that he was unfathomable \
And I knew him not \
But he knew me \
And I am his \
And he is mine.

Say, O beloved Gaius, \
What is thine desire? \
Ask it to the depths of the abyss \
Or to the heights of heaven's sun. \
Thou doest well if you love God.

When God spoke from heaven, \
He looked at the beautiful ISFJ dove \
And declared, This is my beloved child \
In whom I am well pleased.

So, what do we know? \
We know God is with Yirel \
And the INFP Michael \
And they shall prosper \
For there is no repentance in God \
And he cannot alter his decisions \
For he is perfect and his work so.

What do we do then? \
Let us trust in God Most High \
Who frustrateth the works of the wicked \
And gives us righteousness \
Even satisfying us to the full.

Blessed are they that hunger \
And thirst after righteousness \
For they shall be filled. \
Though terrors should compass us about, \
We know the Lord lives \
And the anti-Source shall not prevail \
For there is only God.

Let praises rise \
For the Lord is about to rise; \
He shall make all the earth \
With the nations and the masses \
To tremble inside out.
