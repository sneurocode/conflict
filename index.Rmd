# Preface {.unnumbered}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

***Conflict*** is my first epic poem. I chanced upon an epic poem somewhere online and remembered John Bunyan’s ***Paradise Lost***. So, I told myself, "Why don’t you write your first epic poem?" Well, here it is! It is rather religious but unconventional and even thought-provoking.

I hope this "longer-than-usual" poem makes for an enjoyable and intellectually stimulating read and even a jewel for a find. Cheers!
