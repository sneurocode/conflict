# Vanity

Vanity of vanities; \
All is vanity.

When the viper bites the heels of my horse, \
What shall happen to me or to it? \
I shall stand up after falling backward \
And crush its head with my strong boots.

I have waited for thy Yeshuah, O God!

Of a truth, God has purposed it; \
He took counsel with no one; \
He consulted with none. \
He himself hath purposed it \
To do according to his pleasure.

God hath determined to stain the glory of Ephraim \
And to mar the haughtiness of Hermes \
And to disgrace the treachery of the rebel \
That he might instil fear in his enemies \
To whom he gives the breath of life.

God has determined to dishonour Hermes; \
He will destroy and cut him off \
That he shall be no priest in the room of holiness \
Therefore hath Hermes sinned so vilely \
And stooped so low and fallen so hard,

Therefore did he not fear \
But strengthened himself in sin \
And latched onto the train \
And attacked me early. \
His judgment shall not be stayed.

I have waited for thy salvation, O God.

This shall be the judgment of the wicked, \
Of all the devils that have fought against me \
And desolated me, \
Chiefly, Satan, Hermes, \
Baalzebub and Aphrodite,

This shall be the judgment of Satan \
And his angels \
In the day that the LORD \
Shall break their arms \
And destroy them for their folly,

This shall be their judgment: \
They shall be blind \
And not see the sun; \
They shall be mute, even dumb; \
They shall not be able to read minds \
Just as we have long believed about them;

Moreover, they shall have null feeling \
Like those who are dead \
Who feel neither pain nor pleasure; \
They shall be struck out of Sariel's book, \
Even out of the benefits of Sariel of heaven.

These judgments shall be executed by God, \
Even by God the Saint. \
Not by earthly might nor power \
But by the spirit of God \
Shall the iniquity of the land be removed in one day.

Shiva and Satan \
Shall see darkness and nullness, \
Even emptiness; \
They shall be blind forever \
For strong is the saint that judges them.

This is vanity and vexation of spirit; \
A saint saves while an el can do nothing. \
Araphel and Qerenel behold from above \
And yet there is no salvation in them \
To deliver me from my adversaries.

God considers carefully \
And wonders why there is no one \
To deliver and no arm to save \
And no one to send for an apostle and deliverer. \
Thus, he puts on zeal for a cloak \
And his wrath, it sustains him.

He will surely do it; \
He will put out the remembrance of Satan \
From under the heavens; \
He will take away the bliss of the death ones

And satisfy the judgment \
And get him honour \
And ascend to the glory;

He shall loose \
The shoes of iron and brass \
From off my feet \
And set me at ease \
For there shall be no Asherah or viper to crush.

The desire of the nations shall come; \
All creation shall rejoice \
That the Assyrian is broken in my land \
And that the wicked ones are shattered; \
Surely, Marduk shall not be pardoned.

Tell me, what meaneth this war \
That the adversary hath dealt so bitterly? \
He hath dealt without shame; \
He hath offended without holding back; \
Ephraim provoked me most bitterly;

His blood shall be left upon him; \
He shall taste of all four: \
Ira'ah, itob, iblis and ichesed. \
He shall eat and be full of the judgment of God.

The enemy, the devil, cometh not \
But to kill, to steal and to destroy. \
He hated the earth with bitter hate \
And loathed Adam who was fashioned \
Out of the earth.

Together with Baalzebub, \
Satan, under Marduk's direction, \
Stole our bliss \
Which was a tenth of the heavenly bliss, \
A tenth of the earth's bliss, \
A tenth of the bliss of the stars, \
A tenth of the shalom shamaim

And replaced it with dumbness, \
Stupidity and pain and suffering. \
They made slaves out of us \
And now they return unsatisfied \
To take away the rest of our peace \
And to give us hell.

Baal says they trade in souls. \
Their hatred is great. \
They hate us; \
They cannot fathom the love of God for us

And they keep pondering and asking themselves, \
What is man that God is so mindful of him? \
They visit us and come in place of God \
To vaunt themselves as God

And to lash out with hell. \
They shall have hell in retribution \
For the day of vengeance is in God's heart. \
They shall surely not escape, \
Even every one of them.

Their destruction shall be swift. \
Their judgment shall come in one day. \
They shall be bounced out of bliss \
And fall into the darkness \
Wherein they shall be chained.

Bind them, O God \
With your great chain. \
Lay hold of the dragon \
And bind him up \
That he, mute and blind, \
May deceive the nations no more.

The brides of Hermes shall be stunned; \
They shall be left confounded \
When they cease to hear his sweet voice \
And his deceptions. \
Lots of hearts shall be broken \
And blood will distil as rainwater.

To me belongs vengeance; \
The footsteps of the vile \
Shall slide in due time \
And the things that shall befall them make haste.

Rejoice, O earth with the elect \
For the Lord will reign \
And the iniquity and vexation shall cease \
And the elect shall delight in holiness.

This is but a matter of zeal; \
It is a controversy of motivation \
For even Samael takes on Baalzebub \
And humiliates her, \
Even Samael destined \
To destroy the messenger of Satan, \
That great thorn in the flesh.

Blindness is happened to all \
Therefore there was no one to save. \
The mighty could do nothing. \
The lion and the cherub just sat in their places. \
The mighty Qerenel in whom are all things \
Could not move a finger against Satan.

We all grope at noonday \
As in the thick darkness. \
Araphel, where is your strength? \
Gabriel, wilt thou win a war \
With butterfly wings?

Satan gave a command; \
He said, Fight against none but Saviour. \
Wherever he shall go, there go \ 
And give him no rest \
Whether day or night \
Till we have our prize.

Give them desolation, O God. \
Let them be in desolate places as the dead. \
They came for desolation. \
They came to waste me.

They did not come to profit themselves. \
They came, like Aphrodite, for vanity. \
They came for mockery, \
To steal my honour and sanity \
And to destroy me.

They came to defame me; \
They came for shame. \
They came for vanity. \
They love to slaughter.

They love to harass; \
It shall not profit them. \
They shall not be enriched. \
They shall be impoverished. \
They shall not prosper.

They came to waste me, \
To turn my honour into shame, \
To turn my knowledge into foolishness, \
To corrupt my mental capacity \
And to stop me from learning.

Pseudomic and the vile, \
The fools that forwarded my affliction, \
Said among themselves continually \ 
And they said it in my hearing, \
He is still learning.

They said it; \
Veredel was in the conspiracy. \
Their ways are ways of villainy; \
They are most bitter; \
There is no sweetness in them. 

God will save me. \
O, taste and see that the Lord is good. \
He gives salvation to his son \
And rebukes the company of scorners.

He destroys the proud and haughty, \
Even the proud that exalt themselves \
Against me and lift up the shoulder; \
They are swatted as flies.

Promotion comes from God \
And the strength of salvation is his work. \
He puts down one and sets up another. \
He makes Michael second \
And sets Yirel above him. \
In God's hand is the power to rule \
And the glory to appoint.

So, Michael remains a ben Mishchar forever \
But Heilel perishes, even Heilel, \
The son of perdition and destruction. \
Heilel, the brilliant and shining one \
Who shines with 666‰ light, \
Shall be replaced with an even more brilliant one;

Yirel, the dove that descended upon Jesus \
And strengthened him in the fear of the LORD, \
Shall be Heilel's replacement \
For she is Shachar's beloved child \
In whom God is well-pleased \
And the bath Shachar of the appointment.

Heilel shall howl in pain like Enlil. \
I'm thinking along the lines of 980‰ light, \
About 140 × 7 in light proportion. \
So, Yirel shall destroy Heilel with her shining \
And take him down with the light of her brightness.

So, Yirel, the seventh spirit of God, \
Is the Platinum Chief \
And the Lord or Lady of the Assembly; \
She is Tyr and her nemesis is Enlil, \
The Death Chief.

Michael does not know what to do. \
Maybe, he is waiting for a command, \
A commandment that will never come. \
He cannot be first ruler \
Because he needs direction; \
He must always be guided.

Elijah is scared of death; \
He will not repeat Earth's sufferings. \
Heaven is too sweet; \
Asherah, the Hell, has guaranteed its peace.

Elijah will just mind his business
And pretend everything is ok;
He cannot bear to draw attention
To himself or to announce his presence.

He would rather choose life \
Than die a fool like me. \
Once, he humiliated Baal \
But will proceed no further.

He is scared of death. \
He wants to live \
Like I told myself in my childhood \
And said I would never go to Jerusalem \
For fear of being killed \
When I woke up from my dream.

The devils are in their element; \
The vile ones keep touting Satan \
And swearing by a force \
They have no knowledge of;

They say, He has favoured our undertakings; \
Annuit coeptis. \
Animdife is laughing at them; \
A little kid from an unnamed village \
Who broke out of lockdown is mocking.

What does Animdife mean? \
It means house of the chiefs \
Or house of those who lead in front \
Or house of those who occupy the front seats; \
Wisdom told me I was favoured; \
I'm still waiting for my turn to step forward.

The devil, that leader of the cruel, \
Came after me and attacked. \
The traducer said, I lead \
And I said, Like Baalzebub, \
You have found your match.

The earth is the Lord's \
And the fullness thereof, \
The world and they that dwell in it. \
Marvel not at the dragon. \
He is a thief.

He does not rule the earth; \
He rules illegally \
As a thief \
Till his cup runs out \
And he goes to prison. \
He shall have eternal shame.

All of them that serve idols \
And trust in iguanas that shall not live \
And decorate gods of clay \
And say unto them, Arise and kill, \
All of them shall go into perdition.

Do not pour libation. \
Pray not to the ancestors. \
Do not put your trust in vain idols \
Neither make abominations your god.

They are works of stupidity; \
They have no breath in them; \
They have no spirit \
And they have no honour.

Enlil is but a vexation; \
He has no love; \
His natural senses are dulled. \
He loveth to oppress. 

Read about him; \
He is covenanted with fools \
For that he himself is a fool, \
He cannot but pursue folly.

The satanists that serve Satan \
And worship the goddess, \
That write the name of Jehovah \
And use it in their rituals \
And desecrate the Most Holy,

The witches of Bohemia, \
Those effeminate idiots \
That drink alcohol \
And worship Moloch

Shall pee their hearts out \
Yet shall their sin remain. \
When their blood shall be required, \
Then let the Satan they worship \
Come to their rescue. \
How pleasant their deaths shall be!

Go into the caves. \
Bid the rocks fall on ye \
And hide ye from the wrath of the King \
And the fierce anger of the Lamb \
As he roareth from Zion. 

They build dynasties \
And afflict their progeny. \
They curse their seed \
And add incest to incest.

They shall not profit; \
They shall not see the light \
Because in their boast of illumination, \
They have sinned the sin of Pharaoh \
And dug their graves \
In which they shall not be buried.

They shall not be mourned. \
They shall not be gathered. \
We have given their bodies \
To be scattered as dung \
Upon the face of the earth \
They have profaned and insulted.

Ye fools that organise parties \
And send letters sealed in gold \
And written in fancy letters \
To the young and budding, \
To the up and coming

And bring them in \
And put masks on their faces \
And say to them,

Fill your appetites, \
Eat voluptuously to your lusts \
And defile yourselves; \
Make yourselves vile;

Defile yourselves to hell \
And make Baalzebub happy, \
Even Asherah of the pervert groves, \
For the sin was not cancelled \
And there is no redemption,

Ye fools that persecute souls \
And are skillful to harass and destroy \
Like your father the devil \
And like Asherah your father,

That say to your emissaries \
And hitmen and henchmen, \
Go and strike, \
Strike and destroy that fool,

Ye shall be found fools \
And your rituals \
And your sex magic \
And the prescriptions of Lucifer \
And of your pervert priests of the Brotherhood

Shall not deliver ye \
For ye shall be found fools \
And found fools again \
And found fools after that. \
The greatness of your folly \
Shall never be assuaged.

They pursue Eastern mysticism. \
They chase after Kundalini \
And immerse themselves in sensual Tantra; \
Their wine is the poison of dragons; \
Their honour is to be defiled.

Baalzebub wants to be defiled. \
No, she wants to defile. \
That's why she is the father \
And Satan as Santana is the mother. \
Baalzebub bows down to no one.

The fools shall come down together, \
Each receiving the harassment due him; \
They shall fall as lead into the ocean; \
They shall sink and be found no more. \
They shall not rise; \
Affliction shall not arise a second time.

Go to, learn from the ants; \
They are strong to labour \
Not strong to drink liquor \
Or to partake in foolishness.

A little child shall rebuke ancients; \
A learned one shall insult the intelligence \
Of the haughty and proud \
For they shall come down from their seats, \
All of them slain as Agag

And the noise of the viol, \
The celebration of winter \
And the worship of the sun in the dark season \
Shall cease and everywhere \
Mortals shall acknowledge their mortality.

The God of heaven shall reign; \
His cherub, the cherub of Michael \
That divided the sea \
With the blast of his nostrils 

And demonstrated his power \
Over the leviathan \
Shall destroy them \
With the breath of his mouth.

Behold the sword from the Lord's mouth. \
It proceeds double-edged \
Whirling around and turning; \
It proceeds out to the kill.

Like the sharpness of Isaiah's sword, \
None shall escape its edge. \
It shall be bathed in the heavens, \
Up above where Satan dwells \
And come down upon earth to slaughter. 

Out of the Most High \
Proceeds both good and evil. \
He shall surely execute the wrath \
And not pity. \
He shall not spare.

He has determined it \
And he will do it. \
He shall put Asherah to shame \
And give her bitterness for bliss, \
Shame and a burning heart for joy.

Assemble ye, \
Come ye together. \ 
Stand in the place of judgment. \
Let the books be opened. \
This shall not be vanity.

We shall put an end to vanity. \
It is the last dance. \
Shiva shall dance to her death. \
She shall drink her own blood. \
She shall not have the Baptist's head.

They only love lies. \
They love sweet talk. \
They love to be deluded and deceived, \
To believe that judgment will never come \
Because the Lord can do nothing.

They always want to please themselves \
And Baalzebub, the father of their lusts. \
They love hatred and the hot, boiling blood \
But are as cold as the Serbian winter \
And cannot withstand the furnace and fire.

Against whom do they lift themselves up? \
Against whom do they plot \
With their square and compasses? \
They shall be slain, all of them.

Iniquity shall not save, \
No, not today nor on any other day henceforth. \
The alliance of the wicked with death \
Shall be broken and shattered.

Will you shoot me from behind? \
Will you backstab me? \
Will Cain stab his brother in the back? \
Will Baalzebub stand and slander Michael?

These ones act in an underhanded manner. \
Have you coals of fire to put in my hands? \
Can you touch my lips with a coal of fire? \
Can you draw near to me?

When the wicked prosper, \
Then the heart of the saint is grieved. \
The saint is there for one reason: \
To destroy the works of the devil; \
He will put out the light of Baalzebub \
And trouble sinners \
Till they are shaken out of the earth.

You have to be born a saint to be it; \
You cannot be made a saint; \
It is too sacred an order for another \
To ascend to via any means.

Marduk shall die; \
He shall not deliver Inanna; \
He cannot salvage the soul of Baalzebub \
Nor fight for Aphrodite. 

He and Enlil shall surely envy their enemy \
And both shall be as the darkness \
In the room \
That says, I am blind \
And his fellow shall say, \
What is he thinking?

The screech owl and Lilith \
That Baalzebub is \
Shall look for her mate \
And find him not.

She shall long for Satan \
And be distressed. \
She shall not be comforted \
Like foolish Judah with Tamar. \
She shall believe Nanna is with her

But it shall only bring vexation \
And a frustrated longing \
That cannot be fulfilled \
According to the law of Nanna.

Many shall fly upon cherubim. \
They shall fly to the kill. \
The dead shall die \
By the light of the elect; \
They shall consume away at the brightness \
With Yirel leading the charge.

Where is Lucifer that may save? \
Is he not also light \
Or has he deceived the seducible, \
Even the gullible and deluded?

They shall stumble and fall, \
Every one of them \
Drinking vinegar \
And being comforted with gall. \
Their bread shall be tears and sorrows.

Ask the green herb. \
Ask the green grass. \
Ask the lilies of the pond \
And the mild and gentle vine,

Ask and they will tell you, \
None of these things shall fail \
For the feller shall be cut down \
And he that came up to us \
And destroyed our fine branches;

He shall be uprooted \
That marred our glory \
And led us astray; \
He shall dwell in the depths \
Of the lonesome grave in solitude.

So what shall we say \
To these things \
But that if God is for us, \
Who can be against us?

Who is he that seeks my blood? \
Who wants me dead? \
Who cooked my vexations \
And implements them?

Who stands against me? \
Who is my adversary? \
Who is my enemy? \
Who says I shall not prosper?

Who will come up to me \
Being my enemy wrongfully? \
Who has despised me when I offended not \
But that he could not tolerate the innocent?

That soul shall go to perdition; \
His grave is a grave that is not dug \
For it is not in the earth; \
He shall go to destruction; \
None shall restore him like Nebuchadnezzar. 

Sing, O ye nations, \
Sing, O ye peoples, \
Both far and near, \
Ye of the islands and far continents.

God shall come. \
Thy God shall return. \
His work is with him \
And his reward before him.

He shall smite the ends of the earth \
And give grace and glory. \
He shall give life and breath \
And all that hear shall listen and obey.

Heilel wants to be like Elyon. \
The INTP wants to be like the INTJ. \
Baalzebub called out to me, \
She said, Saviour, keep typing. \
Baalzebub, am I feeding you knowledge \
Before your death?

Gabriel is Daniel's Lord. \
He is a gibor like Kabodel. \
Kabodel abides forever.

As a chief prince, \
Gabriel's death would be most desirable \
To the lords of darkness \
Who rule over the perversions \
Of this our world.

The only saint Kabodel \
Who is co-saint with Shachar \
Has been alive since infinity past, \
Since the genesis of the first universe.

Araphel is Wisdom \
And Qerenel is Understanding. \
They are the King's delight. \
Qerenel has geburah.

Gabriel is the one who says \
Che sara sara. \
What will be will be, he says. \
He is an ardent believer \
In predetermination.

Each one shall receive of his lot \
And stand in his allotted place \
Even if mine is to be harassed by fools \
With Gabriel standing behind me \
With butterfly wings doing nothing.

Asherah is still calling out to me. \
She is mentioning my name \
And saying she hates me. \
She wants blood \
And Marduk responds. 

Go and sleep Marduk; \
It is vanity to stay awake. \
What for? Why do you open your eyes? \
As in the garden, you shall perish!

Baalzebub is twice as rebellious as Satan \
For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft \
And the enchantress will not stop; \
She will not stop experimenting. \
She is consumed with the judgments of Heilel.

She calls herself the roomy one; \
She is the envious and silly one \
Who is full of jealousy \
And purchases souls as a father \
Unto herself and to her son and husband, Satan.

Asherah wants Mammon, \
The spacious one. 

She will give Armageddon to Satan. \
Satan shall stand \
At the base of Har-Megiddon.

But, Satan calls himself Gaia. \
He declares to all that Asherah is a friend-foe, \
A confidant-rival, a benefactor-nemesis \
Whom he would have smitten in the end

If his kingdom were established. \
She is a thorn in his flesh \
Like Joab was to David the king \
Who declared that the sons of Zeruiah \
Were too strong for him.

Asherah, that is, Baalzebub, \
Is the personification of the sexual act. \
She is the antichrist \
And the rival of the spirit of righteousness. 

Her deeds can only be done \
In a body encoded by Mammon. \
Paul declares to himself \
That he shall never stoop \
To bow down to the foolishness of Asherah.

Even those who escape the evil ayin \
Are caught in Asherah's net. \
Hermes fell in and, boy, \
Did he fall in so hard!

I look at those who say \
God commanded us to be fruitful \
And say, Look at these murderers; \
They wouldn't even sympathise \
With the pains of their children. \
There is no wisdom in them.

Asherah could not sing \
To Michael and to God \
When the earth's body was created \
Because it was a body of righteousness \
And she envied his creativity.

The sinners are simple creatures; \
The foolish have not much intelligence \
And understanding \
And they hate to witness brilliance.

Asherah also slanders her own mother's son. \
She consents with a thief and adulterer \
And hast been partaker with aliens.

She slanders Michael \
And blasphemes. \
She calls herself the Lady. She is Freyja. \
She shall shut her mouth. \
We will shut it for her.

With Michael, we shall waste Freemasonry \
And shake the people out of the earth \
And we shall prosper by the four horns \
Of the cherub and of the altar \
And by the rhinoceros of the unicorn.

Everyone who chooses holiness \
Becomes the target of Asherah \
And Aphrodite the great. \
These ones harass and don't stop. \
There's no wisdom in them.

Everyone who loves Asherah \
Hates her in the end. \
She is as odious as a toad; \
Her end is bitterness and torment. \
She shall live peace-free

Like the odious \
Marduk, Heilel and Zuriel of earth \
Who spit out frogs \
And send their uncleanness \
Throughout the world of the damned.

If Asherah and Aphrodite's clothes are their skins, \
Then Satan would have stripped them off. \
He would have flayed them, \
Even made their flesh bare and naked \
And grilled their insides to feed himself \
As the last man standing before dying of hunger.

The bringer of sexuality, \
Even the bringer of the sexual act, \
Can never be first. \
She shall always be subordinate.

The female shall not rule \
Because before her, \
The sexual act did not exist \
And the spirit of righteousness \ 
Was not so vexed as it is this day.

The agony of Asherah \
Is that she calls herself chief and first. \
She says, I am and there is no one else. \
She shall not prosper. \
She shall not prevail.

None can stir up hate and jealousy like she does. \
None can offend like Asherah. \
None can provoke to jealousy like her. \
None can evoke a storm with rage like Baalzebub.

I could not defer \
My programme of instruction till she came. \
I could not experience the worst year ever yet \
Till Asherah did her campaign \
And took over from Aphrodite.

None will experience \
Prolonged devastation and wasting, \
Even desolation and absence of joy \
Like the abominable Asherah \
And Satan and Hermes.

One of the major differences \
Between Satan and me \
Is that my hate comes with a legal reason \
While Satan's hate is with an illegal reason.

The shedim have been probing God. \
They have been searching God \
Like searching spirits \
And illegal entities

And when they find nothing, \
Then they declare, \
Is there knowledge in the Most High \
And does the King have any understanding?

The light encodes nothing; \
It is but raw power. \
The light encodes nothing \
So they think God to be null.

They think him to be some force \
That they can harness and manipulate \
And make their slave \
Or reprogram and repurpose \
To serve their purposes.

Go and hijack the unicorn \
And let him abide by thy crib. \
Put fetters upon his legs \
Like Aphrodite attempts in her foolishness \
When she is proudly declaring herself Father.

Put a yoke upon his neck \
And let him plough thy fields \
With his companion. 

Thou shalt not prosper \
Neither shall sinners prevail. \
The God who forms knowledge \
Shall cut sinners out of it.

Do not listen to the wild lies \
And vanities of the shedim \
Which they fabricate \
And conjure up in their dreams \
And dionysus frenzies.

Their dreams are vain \
Which are as a puff of air \
Which the wolf blows \
Against a wall of brick and mortar. \
He shall huff and puff in vain.

See, nothing is vain. \
Nothing ever happens without design. \
God oversees all things. \
He makes all things \
Beautiful in his time.

Thou shall return and know \
And discern between righteousness and sin, \
Between good and evil, \
Between he that serveth God \
And he that serveth his own lusts.

God tests no one. \
He does not tempt us. \
Remember how his angel \
Was once referred to \
As standing in Balaam's way \
As a Satan?

God tempts no one \
Because he knows all things \
But to prove his servants, \
Michael does tempt persons \
As he tested Abraham \
In the matter of Isaac.

He proved Abraham, \
Even Abraham's loyalty to God; \
He found Abraham faithful to him, \
A servant that could be trusted

For Michael seeks faithful servants; \
He seeks loyalists being an Fi dominant \
And they that are with him \
Are called and chosen and faithful.

He blessed Abraham \
And made him father. \
He blessed him in God's name, \
Even in the name of the LORD.

In Satan's codebase, \
There is a chasm \
Between the amount of pain \
The elect experience \
Compared to the damned.

The odinits of the damned \
Where Satan is \
Are in the tens and hundreds \
While the odinits of the elect \
Are in the ones or zero.

I still do not know \
If any of the elect crosses one odinit. \
God himself does one odinit \
And Michael and his Shulamite \ 
And the latter's brides do zero.

We do not call Satan Odin for nothing. \
He appoints himself many sufferings \
And those he loves who are with him \
Are with him in the blazing furnace \
Which is the light of tobs.

Mammon \
Is the mammon of unrighteousness \
While Zion and Armageddon \
Are the mammon of righteousness.

Mammon encodes all matter \
And all wealth and all bodies \
That are considered ritually questionable \
Or even unclean or impure

While Zion and Armageddon \
Provide the definitions \
For all matter, wealth and all bodies \
That are considered ritually pure \
And clean and holy.

Light entities which are all tob, \
Unlike the ra and ra'ah \
Which are darkness entities, \
Do not encode any knowledge \
And thus are not indexed by the elim.

What bodies does Mammon encode? \
Ritually questionable bodies \
Including all bodies of flesh and blood \
That have an orifice or cavity or body fluids \
Including the bodies of Adam and Eve \
And of Jesus and Paul and myself \
And of every human or animal \
That has ever lived.

Likewise all other sexual bodies \
Including trees, a symbol of fertility, \
And all bodies that depend on external agents to live \
Including viruses and bacteria and fungi \
Because they require nutrition \
Are encoded by Mammon.

All living bodies that are not flesh and blood \
And that are asexual in appearance \
Are encoded by Zion \
And this includes all the bodies in heaven \
Whether animate or inanimate \
Including the bodies of Mammon \
And Armageddon themselves.

The heavenly bodies \
Including the stars and planets \
And meteors and meteorites, \
Comets and the sun and moon \
And the shamaim and raqia \
And the maim and Qerenel \
All have their bodies encoded by \
Zion.

The golden earthly body of Shadel \
Which the false prophet \
Commands to be made for her \
Is also considered ritually pure \
As it is asexual and not of flesh and blood \
And is encoded by Zion.

If the body is made of flesh but ritually pure \
And thus asexual and shut up \
So that it lacks body fluids \
And body cavities and orifices \
Like the bodies we shall have \
In the regeneration when Christ returns, \
Then it is encoded by Armageddon.

So you see, \
Armageddon is a prince among princes, \
A distinguished one and very wealthy \
And he decides the fate of many \
Together with Zion and Mammon his brothers.

Armageddon shall increase in honour \
While Mammon shall decrease \
And become the lowly Ebyon \
Among the nations and continents.

Boast not about your riches, \
O great Mammon of heaven. \
Seek true wealth \
Like the gold of Shemesh \
That thy poverty \
Like nakedness in the cold winter street \
Become not thy undoing and death.

Mammon is the angel of Laodicea. \
He is quite cold for heaven \
Though burning like an oven. \
He registers a temperature of 1,000F \
While the rest score at the normal 10,000F. \
Armageddon is ten times hotter than normal.

That's like the temperature \
Of a bluish O-type star \
Which stars are the hottest, \
Most massive and brightest stars.

You get the idea of what righteousness \
Looks like or feels like. \
I'm sure Apollyon understands. \
Abaddon nods his head. \
He gets it; he understands. 

Zeus, that is, Baalzebub \
Is out there to tame the wild. \
She can only be the wild one here. \
She wants to tame the lightning bolt, \
That blazing and flashing lightning bolt \
That Armageddon is.

She was successful with Satan \
Under Marduk's counsel. \
Now, she eyes Armageddon \ 
And she spies me with her ayin

But I am meek and gentle. \
I will not offend. \
I have never cut the throat of a chicken \
And I keep touting epidural analgesia \
For labouring women.

Kabodel was there in infinity past. \
He gave life to Michael in the beginning, \
At time t=0s \
While Shachar gave life to Heilel.

Their appearance marked \
The beginning of Genesis \
And the two are the firstborn twins \
Of creation.

Michael was given the pathway \
Of work and creation \
While Shachar gave Heilel \
The pathway of rest and observation.

Why did Kabodel join me in the fall? \
Why did she come down? \
Well, when a saint moves left, \
The rest of them follow.

With one spirit like Ezekiel's cherubim, \
They go wherever one goes. \
If one goes for the kill, \
The rest follow.

If one withdraws the hand, \
The rest also withdraw theirs; \
These are the most unified group \
In the whole cosmos \
Like some group of special force.

Mishchar retains a thousand units of ra; \
The ra is for hatred for iniquity \
And the nine thousand tobs to love righteousness. \
Mishchar is Melchizedek receiving tithes \
Even in tob counts.

You can't be a saint and not hate Satan. \
You must hate and execute wrath \
On the adversary, even the oyeb.

God is a saint first \
And a tob and el second. \
It should be clear by now \
That when God works, \
He works through another.

Whether he is creating through Michael \
Or through the sea or earth, \
He almost always has an intermediary, \
A front person to execute for him.

Mishchar is the Word of God \
Who was with God in the beginning. \
Out of her womb comes life. \
She commands her son Michael \
And he creates and fashions things.

Qerenel is the geburah \
Who is the delight of Mishchar, the gibor. \
She is always in his presence, \
The Understanding that was with him \
From infinity past, \
Who was there when Mishchar \
Gave the decrees of creation.

So, Qerenel is the angel of the presence \
Who saves the elect \
By giving the command for Samael \
And the host to destroy the rebels.

She is also the master craftswoman \
With Araphel and the two \
Are the excellent or large and noble ones \
Who guided Michael on how \
To pattern and design creation \
With each command that Mishchar gave.

All things were created for Mishchar. \
He is the book of life. \
All things that live as it is today \
Live because he has commanded it.

God is the Commander-in-Chief standing \
In the midst of his special forces. \
He sets a little child \
In the midst of lions and dogs, \
In the midst of caracals and bears; \
He shall excavate the substance \
Out of Baalpeor with the woodpecker.

In the Genesis story of creation, \
God is the Supreme Commander, \
Mishchar is the General, \
Araphel and Qerenel, \
The Wisdom and the Understanding, \
Are the Colonels \
And Michael and Heilel \
Are the Command Sergeant Majors.

Vanity of vanities, \
Perchance the greatest vanity \
Is that it would be found out in the end \
That nothing and no work of God \
Is in vain or empty.

The works of God are full; \
They are complete for their purpose \
Even if they appear to waver; \
Each fulfills their role to satisfaction.

The Lord directs each \
Including the rebellious \
And the captive \
And the vile and the dishonourable.

He will put each in his place \
And fashion the form appropriate for each. \
The screech owl has her place \
And the deceiver also has his place.

Each shall satisfy \
When accounts are made \
And none shall take us by surprise \
For he hath fashioned them so, \
Each in his day, each in its way.

One advised not to add to the work of God. \
Add not to his works lest he rebuke thee \
And thou be found wanting and a liar. \
Where will the rebukes begin? \
Will they start with Michael \
For taking chances with Mammon \
And giving life to Satan?

I know a pastor \
Who keeps giving prophecies \
And worshipping God. \
When the devils struck out initially,

He gave a prophecy \
And said God wanted me to live \
And not get self-destructive. \
He called me by name

And my neighbours, \
The students nearby in my hostel \
Started to play a notable song with my name; \
I was cautious around them \
And I was grieved at what they did to me.

Do not deceive yourselves \
And say that we never understood your pain \
And never saw that you were afflicted. \
What if God does come and save me \
And it is your turn to be harassed? \
I too will give you words of encouragement \
And not visit you even once or seek your welfare.

I will be like the accursed prophets \
And pastors and shepherds \
Whom James, disgusted at, rebuked, \
The kind that are not deserving of heaven.

They serve God and worship \
And give prophecies \
But have no natural love. \
They do not know what love is \
Though they are married and I am not.

Maybe, a little pain will save them. \
Maybe, they should be in my shoes \
And listen to another pastor \
Put himself in the shoes and place of God, \
A pastor who prophesies a ring \
And money, lots of wealth

And puts up a radiant image \
With rays scattering in all directions \
To demonstrate his brilliance. \
Thou shalt surely be bright; \
I do not doubt it. \
Thou shalt shine for heaven to see

But learn compassion \
And goodness and be kind. \
I have found Christians \
To be too heartless and cold. \
I will die the day I go to church \
On my own accord.

My words are ended.

What shall we end with? \
Fear God and do good \
And he shall bring forth thy light as the day. \
Fear God and depart from evil.

It shall be light to thy soul \
And vitality to thy bones. \
Thou shalt have understanding \
When you pursue the right path.
