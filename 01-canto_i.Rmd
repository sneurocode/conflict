# Lies

Curse Baalzebub, says my soul;\
Curse Bel the liar, says my soul.\
Curse Beelzebub, the prince of demons;\
Curse Asherah, the Egyptian Ra\
Of the Samael family.

There are four chiefs of lies;\
They all go to hell\
And the Christian one too.\
There are four princes of lies\
And they all roast in sorrow.

Tophet is ordained of old;\
For the king it is prepared\
And it burns bright and beautifully;\
It burns with much zeal and splendour.

When Hermes came back from the dead\
Like Osiris of Egypt,\
He realized that there was no hell,\
That the dead are truly dead.\
It was then that he lost his fear\
And became Satan's master.\
His end was worse than his beginning.

Bring forth Nimrod.\
Does Satan seek to rule hell?\
Art thou the prince of darkness?\
Do you rule over souls\
And decide their fates?

Bring forth Nimrod.\
Nimrod is a blasphemer\
And a deceiver.\
He is the chief,\
Even the father of lies\
And Hermes is his son.

Nimrod curses in hell.\
He sent his angel\
And Bunyan paid him a visit.\
Bunyan saw him in his discourse.\
Nimrod, will thou curse Thunder?\
Thunder like him if thou art mighty.

Nimrod is with Nimueh.\
Satan is with Asherah.\
Dagon is with Baalzebub.\
They make ready to raise up Hermes.

The two princes of lies\
Are also the two princes of wickedness;\
They are Rasha and Resha;\
They are Bel and Nebo;\
They are Asherah and Satan;\
They are the queen and the king of heaven.

The four princes of wickedness,\
Even the four princes of iniquity\
Are Baalzebub, Satan, Ninurta and Marduk\
In that order from most wicked to least.\
Ninurta is Sin [h], Sin of heaven.

Aphrodite, Hermes and Shadel\
Are the 5th, 6th and 7th princes\
Of wickedness and iniquity.

Hermes is the sixth\
And the faller who despises grace and love.\
He hates chesed with bitterness\
And God shall make his days most bitter.

Tell me, is Satan the Lord of hell?\
Does he rule with pachad and terror?\
Does he take souls and beat them to pulp?\
Can he bring forth flames\
That may devour persons\
As they did to the servants of Job\
And to his sheep?

Is Satan as mighty,\
Even as mighty and crazy\
As the false prophet,\
As the rock of foolishness,\
Even as the rebel with Shadel\
And the antichrist?

Can Satan call down fire like Elijah?\
Can he repeat his deeds of old?\
How old is he to start with?\
Is he as old as An?\
Can Baalzebub call herself On\
And not be humiliated in the time to come?

Curse the angel of Satan, says my soul.\
Curse the princess of darkness;\
Curse Bel the abominable and vile.\
Curse the daughter of Babylon,\
Even the vile daughter of Babylon\
And the choice daughter of the Assyrian.

There are four chiefs of lies;\
They all roast in the lake of fire,\
In that wide and deep abyss of magma\
Where worms, the voracious maggots,\
Feast incessantly on their bodies\
And make clean work of their devil forms.

There are four chiefs of lies;\
They form the corners\
And sides and angles of the square.\
Baal draws it with his detestable finger.

There are four chiefs of lies.\
They are Satan, Baalzebub,\
Aphrodite and Hermes.\
Trust me, these are the ones;\
These are the ones that roast in the fire.

Satan is the opposite of love\
And Baalzebub is the opposite of life.\
Satan is hell\
And Baalzebub is the bringer of death;\
Both bring pain and suffering.

Satan is the deceiver, the chief,\
Baalzebub is the antichrist,\
The angel of Satan and the enemy,\
The enemy of all things righteous,\
Aphrodite is the curse\
And Hermes is the traitor\
And the lover and hater of our women.

Aphrodite is a fool;\
I'm watching for her destruction.\
What is she? What will she be?\
She will the mother of torments,

The one who stands by Satan's side\
In the great and final war\
And dies, wings broken, by his side\
Crying, save me, kill him, kill him\
Though her words be not heard.

So Aphrodite shall die a fool;\
Baalzebub shall strike the heart of the duck.\
The cold chicken dies.\
Aphrodite was a cow, even a coward;\
She was a golden calf in the desert.

She drew our hearts to her;\
I despised her; I hated her.\
She was the angel, the devil\
That stood for Satan\
To watch and to stand guard\
Over Veredel, the leech.\
She is herself a leech.

She loved herself.\
Aphrodite is a fool\
Who hated herself\
And attacked me\
And gave counsel to the devil.

She is the bul of Jahbulon.\
The Media between Satan and Baalzebub.\
She is the glue or divider between Dagon and Asherah.\
She is the curse between the Moon and the Sun,\
Between Amun and Ra.

Cupid said he didn't want me to die.\
I heard Eros pleading the blood of Jesus.\
Cupid calls himself a cherub.\
He makes himself a chubby baby.\
He says, I'm covenanted with snow.

Aphrodite stood by his table;\
It was a surgical table.\
Maybe, they were wont to pry his wings off\
And kill young Hermes with hypothermia.

Cupid said he loved me.\
The fool vexed me to death\
And trusted in Satan his strength\
And walked with Aphrodite of Venus.\
Aphrodite, art thou the bright star.\
Who is Psyche?

Aphrodite competes with Asherah.\
She wants to be the happy one of Satan,\
The one who delights in Satan her king\
Like Elaine never could\
Because Satan gave her Hermes instead\
And pleased himself in the vileness.

Aprodite says at the gathering,\
Let's strike hard.\
345, let's strike\
That An may be glorified,\
That Satan may cease to be Sat-An\
And rise to become the An.

Aphrodite is a fool.\
She wields a great sword like the antichrist,\
Even like Heilel.\
I said, Aphrodite is a fool.\
She wants to make herself Satan\
According to the philosophy of Baalzebub\
Who says, I am and there is none else.

So, whose advice prevailed\
Like Qerenel whom the Ultimate\
Declared infallible?\
Who prospered like Ashshur the dragon?\
Was it not Aphrodite, the fool,\
Unto whom all the demons gave heed?

She sits on the left hand of Satan\
Waiting to be transferred to his right hand\
When she deposes Baalzebub the Great\
Who will then in shame of face\
Walk over to take the throne of goats\
While Aphrodite becomes the new sheep.

My soul loathes Aphrodite.\
She it was who had Sin right where it pleased her\
And Hermes was shaking his head\
And saying, Come now, come here,\
Baalzebub is not called Bel for no reason.

Aphrodite, art thou a black cat\
Or some black feline?\
Your skin is all scratched out\
And your hair is shaggy.

You are bent on having Sin and Satan.\
Then, the bat flies in the night sky;\
It is Baalzebub; it is Ishtar\
And Aphrodite flees from Nanna.

With the mouth shut,\
She wipes her teeth\
And says quietly in her soul,\
I am a good girl, I have done no wrong.

Aphrodite is a witch;\
She is a sorceress like Baalzebub.

See Aphrodite ready to kill.\
She is ready to drink blood\
And to see Satanism prosper.\
Thou Psyche, Will you\
Disturb the stillness of my mind\
And feign innocency like the accursed Veredel?

Foolish Greeks,\
Your mother, Aphrodite, sends her greetings.\
She is the devil's scribe and counsellor\
And the brain behind my affliction.\
She masterminded the bringing forth,\
Even the bringing forth of Satanism into public.

She wanted to bring Satan to light\
So she would be the true Lucy\
That Bel won't be.\
She wanted to see the earth\
Belong to Satan.\
She wanted Satan accepted.

She says, Witchcraft? Do not judge me;\
Let witchcraft be free\
And legitimate everywhere.\
Let men and everyone defile themselves\
Wherever light does shine\
And not only in the darkness.

She wanted to start with me;\
The voices, you get the message.\
She wanted to start with me\
And tear the veil between conscience,\
Between morality and foolishness,\
Between sound judgment and perverse perversion.

So, Aphrodite is your hardened fool,\
The one who directs the devil's war on the saints\
And leads the charge like an armourbearer\
Against righteousness and the spirit thereof.

Aphrodite is the special force,\
Even the special force with Satan\
At your door.\
She is sin waiting to happen.

She wants to wed you to sin\
And excavate your heart of righteousness\
And replace it with vanity.\
She wants you to die,\
To die and never wake up again.

Aphrodite hates it when I learn.\
She leads the charge writing fast\
Like an impatient soul who cannot wait.\
She has no patience and wants results.\
He is still alive and hates us.\
He is still alive and not the sinner I planned.

She says to me, You can't harm me.\
You can do nothing to me.\
You can do absolutely nothing to me.\
Aphrodite leads the charge and confrontation\
Like the opposite or antithesis\
Of the spirit of the fear of the LORD\
Who is a humble, peaceful and gentle ISFJ.

Aphrodite is a fool.\
She lacks understanding.\
She shall not prosper\
Neither in this world nor in the one to come.\
345 herh, wait for me!\
I have plenty experiments planned for you;

How does pancuronium feel like?\
How do loud voices on loudspeakers\
In a deep dark prison room of an abyss\
Without windows and air\
While being blasted\
With images that are stunning\
Feel like?

As Psyche, can you withstand\
All forms of psychological torture\
And still stand?\
Will your knees crumble or fold over?\
Are you curious and waiting\
With the rest of the dead and foolish ones\
To find out?

She visited me with Baalzebub.\
She came with the cursed one.\
They came with determination.\
Their clothing was their hide or scales for a skin.\
She was smaller and shorter.\
She looked like Asherah's sister.

Of a truth, Baalzebub is a prince,\
The princess and gebereth\
Among the twenty princes of heaven\
But Aphrodite is a little one\
With a body of electrum

That is one-thousandth the dimensions\
Of the golden giant Asherah is.\
So Aphrodite is Satan's concubine\
While Baalzebub is Satan's wife and queen\
With whom he regenerated us\
In his image and lusts\
After birthing the vile fruits of the accursed tree.

Why did they attack me?\
I do not know.\
Aphrodite hates my intelligence.\
Cupid wants my heart.\
No, Aphrodite wants my heart.

They want me to die\
If perchance Michael will die with me\
So Satan's kingdom can be established.\
They want me to stop learning;\
They hate my love for learning\
And my love for my grades\
And how my reputation in my eyes\
Depends on my intelligence and my grades.\
They want to shatter the foundations of what I hold dear.\
They hate that my god is my intelligence.

They call themselves the judgment\
And gods.\
They are worthless idols\
With a worthless Enlil working hard with Marduk,\
An abominable Enlil selling me I\
nto the hands of Aphrodite.

Baalzebub is a goat,\
Even a full grown mother goat\
Clinging onto Armageddon for dear life.\
She shall be held in prison bars,\
Held in for eternity\
And never get to see the beauty of Armageddon again.\
Take away their eyesight.\
We will destroy the ayin of the ra'ah and Ra-Bel.

Baalzebub is Baalzebul;\
She shall sit in darkness\
Unable to perceive the form\
Of Sin her beloved.\
She shall cry to him\
But no sound shall proceed forth\
For she shall be mute and blind\
With her disabled angels or demons.\
None shall heal them\
For Raphael himself shall be sick.

Baalzebub is a strong goat\
Holding on to a pile of sand,\
A small sand hill\
For dear life.\
She shall not prosper\
Because her desolations are wonderful\
And they are eternal.

O! How is the mistress of harlots fallen,\
How is Satan fallen from heaven,\
How is Baalzebub fallen with disgrace!\
She and her companions,\
They grope in the darkness\
In broad daylight.\
They cannot see a thing\
Because of the might of the Strong One;\
The Just God is his name.

Who will lament with me?\
Call them to yalal!\
How shall Asherah sing?\
Who will play the tabrets for her?\
Where is Aphrodite?\
Is there no Satan to comfort?

A little sorcery here\
And a little robbery there.\
A little murder here\
And a little deception there\
And we will divide the spoil in the morning,\
At daybreak

After we have slaughtered our victims\
In the dead of the night.\
We shall share garments!\
We shall be clothed and rich\
And be covered over with jewelleries.

Except the Lord had left us\
The power of hearing,\
We had dwelt in the region\
Of the shadow of death.

Say, who has done this?\
Who showeth mercy in wrath\
And restrains the fullness of the stroke\
And poureth not out the full stretch,\
Even the fullness of the bitterness.

Seek ye the light and ye shall live.\
Seek not the darkness\
Nor the depths of Satan\
For ye shall surely die!

They have no understanding;\
They do not know.\
Satan warns from across the street;\
He says, Stop teaching.\
Baal points to a sheet of paper.\
Baal, are you the teacher?

Turns out Baal is not only a master or lord,\
He is also a husband and teacher.\
He is a faithful son waiting to be become a Reuben.\
He is Dumuzid waiting to please his father\
According to the purity or rather vileness\
Of Satanic law.

Baal shot me in the head.\
He shot me in the back of the head\
Just as Cain stabbed Abel in the back\
So that his blood ran along the ground\
Crying vengeance, vengeance, vengeance.

Baal is a soldier in the path.\
Enlil is a general; he is a chief;\
He is the head of the qedeshim\
And his right is Baalzebub\
And Aphrodite for qedeshot;\
Add Satan and Baal as his qedeshim.

Baal is a confident one;\
He tells me to pray.\
Who shall I pray to?\
Shall I pray to An, to Michael?\
Shall I pray to a god I cannot see?

Baal walks around.\
He is a behemah, a goat.\
He is not an adam.\
He is an ESTP male.\
He is a ruach.\
He is not a ra'ah.

Tell me, what becomes of Baal?\
What becomes of Baal?\
Baal is with Asherah.\
They are both happy.\
They are silent in the grave.\
Sin rules over them in the prison house.

They are blind and mute;\
Good gracious, we left them hearing;\
They shall hear wisdom and vexation\
Because I will publish the abominations of their souls,\
Even the justice they loathe\
And wander away from to sin\
And to wreak havoc and abominations.

Enlil is an idol.\
He is an elil\
And the chief of the elilim.\
He is a rebel.\
He shall not profit.

Enlil wants me to worship idols.\
He wants to kill me.\
He laments; he is fed up.\
He says, I am a thorn in the flesh,\
A prickly pear, a thorny rose.\
I pierce the side of my murderers.

How many devils tried to kill me?\
Baal failed; Enlil came for my life-force.\
The wolf howled at the moon\
But I was the one in distress.\
The ISFJ came to my rescue.

Aphrodite impersonates Veredel.\
Enlil sold my soul to Aphrodite.\
Just kill him for me, that's all I ask;\
That was Enlil's plea,\
Even the plea of a distressed Enlil\
Sitting on his throne\
With Nanna, the great Sin, before him.

They want Sin to shut up;\
Suen is with me;\
The Assyrian general and king\
Who replaced his brethren\
And worshipped Nisroch or Ninurta,\
His own linked spirit, is with me.

That's why, like Sennacherib,\
The sword and knife keeps\
Terrorizing me\
And I even saw a terrorist\
Kill an American journalist\
In the desert on tv.\
The Arabians are the problem, huh.

Baal stood before Sin;\
He pointed to a sheet of paper\
With the number 99 on it;\
Counsel was in the second column\
And had a sheet of paper before her\
Which spelled the figure 100.

Baal pointed to Sin's sheet in glee\
As if to say, Your murderous son\
Adrammelech testifies that I, Hadad, rule.\
Sin was silent unlike Adam.\
Sharezer who should have been\
The King's protector murdered him\
And Asshur's gift ruled instead.\
Esarhaddon ruled in Sin's place.

Satan is screaming in my ears.\
He is a confused fool.\
He is deceived if he thinks\
These torments are mine to bear.\
I'm just the messenger.\
I am the units of the plagues\
And not the fullness itself.

Baal has his hand over Nanna's mouth.\
Inanna is out of sight.\
Elsewhere, Might stands before me;\
He tells me, I'm the real fear.\
He is Might and not a spirit of fear\
Who just slipped away.\
Definitely, someone has got to be the terror.

Samael stands on guard.\
The war is about to begin\
But this is no war;\
It's a delusion.\
The adversaries are unwinged;\
They cannot fly;\
They cannot ascend.

This is a one-sided war;\
It mocks Satan and Aphrodite.\
Baalzebub is in it.\
Hermes is banging at the door\
Of blindness and muteness,\
Crying, Let me out of here\
That I might stir up judgment and victory.

Hermes wants the grave.\
This time, he and Baal with him\
Shall not rise again.\
They shall swim in Sheol\
And perish forever.

How can Satan fight without Asherah?\
In the tree, she was all he had.\
She was his first wife.\
Actually, in the tree,\
Marduk said to invert gender\
So Asherah was Asher, the father\
And Satan was Santana, the mother.

Thus, Asher and Santana\
Gave birth to the cedar fruit\
That desecrated adam\
And the entire human race,\
The same fruit that makes me sick.

Marduk is with me.\
Enlil said I must die.\
I reasoned, How foolish can this guy get?\
Enlil said I must die.\
I'm still wondering if he knows his end.

Someone was harassing me in a dream.\
He said I should put an end\
To this misery that had befallen me.\
I'm still wondering if he was mocking\
Or if he truly believed in me\
Or if he was a confused Pharisee\
Testing the waters or who knows what.

Give me bread\
But not Satan's flesh.\
Tell me, Is Santana beautiful?\
When I see her, shall I want to sport\
Or will I be repulsed?

The fool of a devil\
Keeps impersonating me.\
He had bad dealings with Hermes\
And Elaine was their playground.\
Santana loved Hermes,\
A little too much.

He chased Hermes several hundred miles\
And Baalzebub brought him into his arms\
Saying, Today have I begotten your son\
And put away from him\
The folly of righteousness.\
He shall no more seek righteousness\
Nor mention purity.

He shall live for the sin\
And defile women\
As long as heaven and earth endures\
And may all the desecrated and vile\
Say Amun, Amun, Amun!

So shall they be mute like cattle\
At moondown and cut off at sunrise.\
When the enemy shall come in\
Like a flood,\
The spirit of the LORD shall lift up\
A standard against him

And they shall dwell in their houses\
And limit themselves to their rooms.\
None shall peer into another.\
None shall make another afraid\
For they all are but mortals.

O, Enlil, wherewith shall I pacify thee?\
The Anunnaki, even the sons of An,\
Are confounded; they are confused.\
Shadel can't wait to start sinning proper.

The Arab is confused about Marduk.\
She allied with Marduk.\
She made the Tigris river\
For she is herself a tigress.

Enlil consulted with Aphrodite.\
Aphrodite is a black cat in my room.\
She calls Veredel a witch.\
She is a black cat in my room\
Waiting to destroy.

She said, Now, God can't stop us.\
I was with a vile lass at the time.\
I was also with Android and coding\
And the flesh was still with me.

The strength of Aphrodite is her foolishness;\
She is on her way to destruction;\
She shall go into perdition with Veredel.\
She is a fool;\
She shall not profit.

Her goal is to kill me\
With something silly\
Like unrequited love or the like.\
Her strength is to find a wicked one,\
A silly one, make me fall down\
And take me for a spin,\
A spiral course whose endpoint\
Is death and hell

And you wonder why Enlil kept at it;\
Call her, he says,\
And he kept talking to me\
And he brought\
His deathly depressive presence\
Down upon me\
Each time I sat by the cursed lass.

Someone asked me\
If I wanted to kill someone.\
It was one like unto a mad man\
I met a few blocks away from my home.\
Veredel was taking me for a spin\
In those days.\
I was mad; I was crazy\
And I should have known\
Aphrodite was winning.

The strength of the accursed Aphrodite\
Is Sin or Suen when he is crazy.\
He brought the delusions\
And the vile imagery.\
He laid the foundation for my enemies\
And his Nisroch is a 99-tob Satan.\
I would have given him up to be with Inanna.\
Inanna should be Baalzebub\
And not Aphrodite.

In what have I offended?\
How did I err against Aphrodite?\
She wanted to be the Aphrodite\
And not Veredel. I'm sorry, my bad!\
Visit infinity;\
Baalzebub is truly indeterminate\
With Marduk her pal.

Someone wanted my phone.\
He wanted the lists therein.\
I said, Sorry, you can't look.\
You can't see my contacts.\
There will no more be fools.\
We will make sure\
Foolishness is cut off permanently.

The conflict has been long.\
There have been lots of dreams\
And lots of broken dreams.\
Many broken desires\
And dismayed hopes.\
This is war; you've got to catch that.

Veredel was my curse.\
What kind of ungodly alliance\
Exists between Aphrodite and Sin\
And between Sin and everyone else.

I can tell the difference\
Between Ninhursag as Nanel\
And Ningal as the pervert Shadel.

The wing of abominations is Nanel;\
He is my treacherous cherub\
And his name means he is strong.\
He is the shaggy goat of the mountains.

Nanel shall be ridden by Shadel, the desolater;\
His fire shall kill the two witnesses.\
Shadel is truly a waster,\
She and her golden dragon;\
This is one hell of a female Killer Bean.

These Babylonian guys disgust me.\
Sin is a pervert.\
He has vile relations with Ningal.\
Shadel is defiled; he is not pure.\
Islam is vanity.\
Adamah makes me sick.

Shadel is the grim reaper.\
She was the one who founded Islam.\
She impersonated Gabriel her chief prince\
Of whose course she was.\
She is Allah;\
May Illai forgive her.\
She is the crescent moon\
Waiting as she wanes to be shed in menses.

She is the seeing Satan\
Who leads the blaspheming opposition\
In the War of the Purge.\
She descends to become Satan's guide.\
She will be Satan's angel\
And take the place of Baalzebub.\
Every ezer of Satan is a female.\
She is worse than a Mord'Sith.

Like Heilel, she says as Allah\
That she wants to be like the Most High;\
Her prayer will be answered.\
She would not only remain an elil\
But Are the reason the shedim became bold <br> And attacked me in this
war of desolation.

Marduk is not your holy child.\
He is the Komodo of sweetness,\
Whose flesh makes us glad and fat.\
We shall have strength to work the soil.

Ninhursag is the lady of the pinnacle.\
She says she rules the high place,\
The very pinnacle where Jesus should have stood,\
The very pinnacle where Baal should rise to,\
The very pinnacle Satan stretches his neck from.

Ningal is the great lady.\
She's been mocking me since I was conceived.\
She's been calling me a fool.\
She says she is my mother like Marduk.

Marduk is a male;\
He can never be holy.

Mawu prophesied.\
She declared my fate by a prophet,\
Yeah, even by a false prophet.\
Thanks to her, my life is ruined.

She said I would be a doctor;\
The code is M for medicine\
And she declared herself the fullness,\
The chief, the ruler and the last.

I heard the ISFJ speaking with Enlil.\
She also looked like Veredel\
And I fancy she is her linked spirit.\
She is like the slave girl who was overjoyed\
At Peter's voice\
When he had been rescued by Michael\
And delivered from prison.\
The whole thing looked like a dream,\
A delusion to Peter\
Till he awoke fully.

I heard her speaking with Enlil;\
Enlil was saying,\
I don't want a doctor in my family.\
She said gently and with much caring love\
In her voice like the phlegmatic ISFJ that she is,\
What if you are sick?

I didn't know an exalted one,\
That a god or an idol like Enlil\
Could fall sick.\
Enlil gave me a poison to treat my cough.

I tell you, Foolishness is real;\
The wickedness has been with me\
Since my conception;\
I have never known peace.\
They forbid shalom in any of my members.

Now I understand.\
Enlil is going down\
And his end is not good.\
His sorrows are worse than mine.\
He is filled full with sickness\
And torture.

I think I love Qerenel.\
She is On, the true On.\
She is like a sister to me.\
The confused ones\
Think her my consort\
But, honestly, she just loves me.

Baalzebub calls herself Jupiter;\
The queen of heaven\
Calls herself the king of the gods.\
Baalzebub, O Baalzebul,\
When will you repent?

Qerenel is Jupiter Hellenius,\
Jupiter the Greek.\
She mocks at Baalzebub.\
Qerenel is an altar-table\
In the room of my beloved.

Abaddon is the abad On;\
The king of the Ra\
Is the servant of On,\
The faithful servant of Qerenel.\
What does this mean?\
It means Qerenel watches over Abaddon\
And Satan cannot harm him.

Sheol or Hades is Abaddon's consort\
And his son is Peniel, the ra sus\
That Abaddon rides on to the kill;\
You know it was Abaddon\
And not Araphel who killed\
The Egyptian firstborn at leila.

Peniel is the spirit of time\
Or the personification of time.\
Of course, he is not Cronus.

We define time as 2 infinity infinitons\
With one infinity infiniton being\
How long it takes for a ra\
To count the total number of ra there are\
In the outer darkness;\
It takes an infiniton to count one ra.

Did Satan take a cue from this?\
The prince of darkness\
Provoked David to conduct a census.\
Does Satan also seek knowledge?\
Let him start by learning to play a keyboard.

Now, in one second,\
A ra can count as many ra\
As the magnitude of the speed of light.\
So, there you have it!\
An infiniton is a second\
Divided by three hundred million\
Or by three times ten to the eighth power!

Qerenel is the spirit of music,\
The eighth spirit of God\
Just as Michael is the first spirit of God\
And the only spirit of God for that matter.\
Michael is the spirit of God that moved\
Over the dark waters.

Qerenel was the lying spirit;\
She shall surely prosper.\
Assyria shall not profit.\
Marduk shall faint and die.\
The unicorn like Qerenel shall kill him.

Qerenel is the evil spirit from God;\
She cannot fail.\
She shall avenge me on my enemies\
And help me regulate the portion of the wicked.\
She shall regulate their odinits.

She is a tob el. "She is fully light;\
In her is found no darkness\
And her song most sweet.\
She lies by the mouths of prophets.\
Does Sin alone rule over delusions?

Qerenel is the darkness of space.\
What do you understand by a lying spirit?\
She is definitely female.\
She is a geburah and most pure.\
She shall sing for joy of heart\
And honour her king.

Marduk passed by.\
Sin was playing me.\
Wait, Sennacherib, am I the one?\
I was asleep.\
I'm hearing Satan's voice\
Saying vilely to post it.\
Look, Marduk, bid me do it in a dream.

Truth be told,\
Satan and Baalzebub are never first.\
They just are not smart enough.\
Satan is depending on Marduk\
Or on Aphrodite to know what to do.

Satanism cannot exist without Christianity.\
They just are not cut out for it.\
They are built to impersonate.\
They must see something\
And then apply a negation or opposing function.\
Why do you think Satan is called the adversary?\
He is an oyeb; he is designed to oppose.

The wrath of the oyeb is foolishness;\
It goes no where.\
O, it goes somewhere!\
It goes to hell.\
It goes to hell.

Why do you think they attacked me?\
I've been hearing vile voices since 2022.\
That was the same year\
In which the AI boom or explosion began With the beloved AI giant going
live in late fall.

Satan knew what he was preparing for.\
Is this how they train their\
Richard Rahl and Mord'Sith?\
Impressive! Fascinatingly vile!

This war was launched at my conception.\
They swore I shall be prisoner forever,\
That I shall die without knowing peace\
Or the pleasure that is in bliss.

So I also calculated;\
I said, I will the plagues of hell;\
I will be the plagues of the grave.\
Repentance shall be hid from my eyes.\
Cry to God if he will save you.\
No one came to my rescue.\
No one saves anyone.

Qerenel did her part.\
Her deeds are listed in the pages of history —\
How she deceived an outsmarting Ahab\
Who fell down at the hands of Tom.\
Tom is Araphel.\
He is the Raqia who separates us from Qerenel.

Tom, pronounced Tome,\
Was the unknown man\
Who took down Ahab\
With an arrow shot to his heart.\
Ahab's heart was wicked\
Just like Sin who sits over my heart\
And Araphel took him down with his heart.

Beware the Arabs.\
From what I hear and searched out,\
Heilel is Arab\
And she is Lebanese,\
A Tyrian Muslim.

Shadel is attached to her from heaven.\
You know I'm alone and will forever be.\
Shadel shall come for blood and famine.\
Blood shall flow like rushing streams\
And as torrents when a dam collapses.\
Whole villages shall be flooded with blood.

Shadel is a tigress,\
Even a lone tigress wreaking havoc.\
Heilel is a black panther,\
Even a black leopard\
Who is also partly lion and bear.

The first tigress that appeared to me\
Was Aphrodite.\
The second was Shadel\
And the funny one\
That said he wanted to eat me up\
Was Satan;

The shameful monkey inside him\
Was Baalzebub who cowered and was mute.\
O dear, how much Satan loves his Aphrodite!\
He is ready to swim for her.

Why is there sin in my heart?\
Why can't I be happy?\
How can I be happy\
When Sin rules my heart\
And impersonates me?\
He is the reason I fell for Veredel;\
The great and mighty man that I am fell\
And Sin was in the midst of it.

There is always some fool,\
Some fool too wise\
Trying to take me down\
While pretending to be my friend,\
Some devil or shed\
Looking out for my destruction\
In the name of seeking my welfare.

Why is Sin so vile?\
Can't he see the future?

Tell Satan to shut up;\
I will vex him for two full hours if I need to.\
Samael, stand on guard.\
Thou shalt avenge me as an adam\
On the fool who sought to drain Adamah\
Of her life-force.

My enemies shall not be buried.\
They shall not be gathered.\
They shall be as the dung spread out,\
As the stink of Balaam that cannot fade\
Or as the rotting flesh of Lot's daughters.

Do you understand what is in war?\
You don't fight against a young child,\
Against a young child who has done you no wrong.\
Just because I read from a prayer book\
And sought to command the morning\
And sought to bind up the queen of heaven,

They seek my neck and blood.\
They want me to become more perverse than Hermes,\
The abominable patron of thieves\
Who wields the caduceus of Mawu the Great and Wicked.

These rotten fools\
Would cry and swear innocency\
Even when they hold the blade\
Slashing away at your throat;\
Think about Islam spilling blood\
And saying terror is peace.

I took a line from their script\
And said, Mahomet goes to hell\
And he is nothing like Moses.

Baal saw me.\
He must have been the first visible entity\
I thought was God.

Baal called me Moses\
Or at least suggested it.\
I don't know exactly what he meant\
Or even if he thought Moses had returned.\
These guys are full of confusion.\
They can't read anything.

I'm taking Bel away from Satan.\
I'm calling for a divorce.\
In those days, there were many,\
Many who oppressed me\
And said many things.

Veredel will soon learn of her folly.\
She will know she has been foolish.\
She should not have lived.\
Her existence has brought much pain and sorrow.\
She rules over gender\
And says she shall be both.\
She shall be the man and the woman.\
Aphrodite is jealous.

Marduk is a traitor.\
We have nothing in common.\
He is male but portrays himself female.\
He is an INTJ but makes himself\
An ISFP and sometimes an ESFP.

Marduk is not the golden calf;\
That was Aphrodite\
And boy, did she prosper?\
Through Aaron,\
She made the Israelites naked\
That we might gaze on the obscene.

When God is clothing Adam and Eve with Marduk's skin,\
Aphrodite comes along and says,\
Take off your clothes\
Like Hermes calling himself Satan the King\
Did to Elaine before the vile congregation.

Aphrodite aroused rage and zeal;\
She defiled the eyes of the righteous\
For she is the evil ayin;\
She causes to behold vanity\
And Sin and Marduk and Bel take it from there.

I will mention the lovingkindnesses of God\
Who protects the law\
Even when it is broken.
