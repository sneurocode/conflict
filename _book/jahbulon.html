<p>Do you seek wisdom?<br />
Do you seek to escape the darkness?<br />
Do you seek a little peace?<br />
Do you seek a little sanity?</p>
<p>Many persons crave fame;<br />
They want some honour,<br />
Some connection and affiliation<br />
To some powerful organisation<br />
But is there a price to pay?<br />
Is it gold so long as it glitters?</p>
<p>You see the determined devil<br />
Not only founded Islam or Mahometry<br />
But also raised up Freemasonry.<br />
He put together his codes and symbols,<br />
His passwords and secret hand gestures<br />
And codified them into his system<br />
Of knowledge and enlightenment.</p>
<p>A little that a righteous man has<br />
Is better than the riches of many wicked<br />
And he that shall soon be rich<br />
Shall find that he shall have lots of sorrows.</p>
<p>They conspire against the God of heaven.<br />
Come, they say, and let us undo his cords;<br />
We will cast away his bands from us<br />
And build our own morality and values<br />
And teach our own laws and delights.</p>
<p>They have replaced Jehovah with Jahbulon;<br />
They have taken the great An<br />
And thrown him out of his throne<br />
And set the devil and his spouses<br />
In his place where righteousness<br />
Should have sat and ruled.</p>
<p>Jahbulon is the unholy trinity;<br />
It is composed of Jah, Bul and On.<br />
Jah is the usurping devil,<br />
Bul is Aphrodite<br />
And On is Baalzebub.</p>
<p>These three are also the interfacing entities<br />
That sit at the transition point<br />
Between the war and love groups<br />
Of the second band<br />
Of the infinite domain.</p>
<p>Satan is folly or foolishness,<br />
That is, Nabal or Nebo.<br />
Aphrodite is silliness;<br />
She is impulsive<br />
And has no prospect of success.<br />
Baalzebub is the lord of the fly,<br />
Even the lord or lady ruler of Satan<br />
And is full of envy because of Aphrodite’s<br />
Proximity to Satan.</p>
<p>Satan lacks good sense and judgment;<br />
He is not wise<br />
And has little intelligence;<br />
He is Aphrodite’s brother and twin</p>
<p>They call Baalzebub On<br />
Because they say,<br />
She is the prince of Grecia<br />
And the symbol of strength.<br />
She is the symbol of vitality and lust<br />
As of a strong man in the perverse act<br />
And they call Masonry a system of morality!</p>
<p>Baalzebub is the Egyptian Ra.<br />
She is the centre of sun worship,<br />
The Heliopolis and the centre,<br />
The very centre of sorcery.<br />
Her delights are witchcraft;<br />
She is most perverse.</p>
<p>Baalzebub is Freyja of Friday,<br />
The Norse goddess of love, battle and death.<br />
She is the one who rides a wild boar<br />
Or flies in a chariot pulled by cats.<br />
Her golden necklace, the Brisingamen,<br />
Crafted by the dwarves of Satan,<br />
Spits the poison her heart manufactures.</p>
<p>Marduk is Frigg of Friday,<br />
Satan’s, that is, Odin’s wife.<br />
She is the Norse goddess of magic
Or foresight or ``prophecy’’ and motherhood.<br />
Her spinning wheel puts her<br />
At the level of the cherubim of Ezekiel.<br />
Like Heilel, she thinks herself a cherub.</p>
<p>With her spindle, she spins lies<br />
And weaves destinies into destruction<br />
And shame and agony<br />
And does not spare herself.<br />
Aprodite calls out the number 1;  
An, she says<br />
While Marduk calls out 3;<br />
The trinity she proposes.</p>
<p>Sin comes out;<br />
Let him say 4 or be silent;<br />
A rapid change happens in the fourth year;<br />
The fourth year is 2022.<br />
Sin is bold; he is a storm like Hadad.</p>
<p>Baalzebub says 7<br />
According to the number<br />
Of shiva and Shiva;<br />
Satan, that is, Moloch, declares 13;<br />
Thirteen it is!</p>
<p>Baalzebub wants me to mourn,<br />
She wants me to yalal<br />
For a full week of years.<br />
Is she obsessed with the Ethiopian skin<br />
And with the Queen of Sheba?</p>
<p>She has sevened herself;<br />
She has taken the oath<br />
Like the Angel swore and cursed.<br />
She has taken the oath<br />
And sworn by herself, Marduk and Satan<br />
That I shall not take the oath.</p>
<p>I will give Baal 2<br />
And Hermes 5;<br />
Shadel shall be 6.</p>
<p>Hermes, the much loathed Hermes<br />
Is the fool who does not understand<br />
Grace and love and kindness.<br />
He shall taste of anti-chesed;<br />
He shall gnash his teeth<br />
In pain and hatred for God.</p>
<p>Shadel shall taste of ira’ah.<br />
He shall open the womb of hellfire<br />
In pain and anguish and bitterness.<br />
When I wake up, I’m calling her name<br />
And cursing Islam<br />
And the satanism that inverts gender.</p>
<p>Shadel is the destruction of Heilel.<br />
She is the corrupting influence on him.<br />
Heilel is yoked to a fool,<br />
To an anti-saint elil waiting to happen.<br />
The English is yoked to the Arab<br />
And the fruit thereof is villainy.</p>
<p>You see why<br />
The four princes of wickedness<br />
Are Satan, Baalzebub, Nisroch and Marduk<br />
In that order?</p>
<p>Marduk is full of villainy<br />
And hypocrisy.<br />
He was the one who wedded<br />
Asherah to Satan in the tree<br />
After 33.5 times of Adam enjoying shalom.</p>
<p>His desire is the force and inmortality;<br />
He wants to be free from the body<br />
And regain the honour of the heavenly;<br />
He wants to rule in life.</p>
<p>His knowledge is full of bitterness.<br />
It is most cruel like the poison of dragons  
And the cruel venom of asps;<br />
It shall only destroy and humiliate.</p>
<p>Jesus too was 33.5 times<br />
When he was cut off.<br />
He was thirty times when the Spirit came upon him,<br />
When he was baptised by the Baptist<br />
And he confirmed the covenant of grace<br />
With many for half a week in times.</p>
<p>Satan was a barren high tree in the garden;<br />
He produced no fruit<br />
Like the fig tree Jesus cursed.<br />
He was the tree of death,<br />
The destroyer of the earth<br />
Who was predestined to be destroyed.</p>
<p>He kept sucking the life-force out of the ground.<br />
When Asher joined Santana in the tree,<br />
He opened Santana’s womb<br />
And brought the vile fruit out.</p>
<p>Today, Freemasonry<br />
Honours Boaz, Tubal-cain<br />
And many other vile fruits.<br />
They also honour apples<br />
And tomatoes, rotten ones.</p>
<p>It’s been six years of war,<br />
A war that likely began in 2019;<br />
The devils came together;<br />
Satan planned to afflict me for 13 years<br />
And we’ve done six years so far.</p>
<p>These fools did not pick a G for seven<br />
But picked an M for thirteen<br />
According to the name of Marduk or Moloch,<br />
According to the name of Baalzebub as Maia<br />
And according to an M for mem<br />
In the Hebrew word “em” for mother.</p>
<p>The mother that Jahbulon is<br />
Has decided to give birth to an M<br />
And not a G of sufferings.<br />
She shall rot in hell.</p>
<p>Marduk calls herself the European prince;<br />
Her daughter will be Heilel<br />
Who is the downcast Hel<br />
Of Norse mythology,<br />
My one and only Helena.<br />
Blavatsky, how is it cooking?</p>
<p>Marduk calls herself the militant chief;<br />
She is the chief of military strategy;<br />
She is the Assyrio-Babylonian Roman,<br />
Babylon the Great<br />
And the speaker of confusion and lies.</p>
<p>She is the European power,<br />
The European moloch,<br />
The European melek<br />
And the European chief duke.<br />
She must fight to success.</p>
<p>Aphrodite is the Bul<br />
Because she also feigns strength<br />
Like the strength of a bull,<br />
Like Baalzebub the Great.<br />
She was the golden calf of the desert<br />
And she prospered at her defamation<br />
Of the holiness of the children of Israel.</p>
<p>When Satan says of her<br />
That she is from the family of the ox or bull,<br />
He means that she, as one person,<br />
Is worth the entire cosmos<br />
Beside Baalzebub.<br />
Think then what the Asherah<br />
Of Satan’s right hand is worth to him.</p>
<p>Satan is the Yah;<br />
He calls himself Amun;<br />
He says he always gets what he wants<br />
And no one is able to resist him<br />
For I, says he, am the king.<br />
Satan is a slanderer, a traducer<br />
And blasphemer.</p>
<p>He lies down in the grass;<br />
He eats to the full<br />
Then belches on a full stomach<br />
Like an Indian surgeon<br />
Whom the locals call a god.</p>
<p>He belches and curses heaven.<br />
He takes in the view<br />
And wallows in pride.<br />
None shall correct him<br />
For he is above all in his eyes  
And cannot see at what he stumbles.</p>
<p>Satan is the Yah;<br />
He thinks himself the owner of life<br />
With the power to determine<br />
If another should live or die.<br />
He opens his hands<br />
And says, Look,<br />
Your destinies are in my hands.</p>
<p>He says, like the Angel,<br />
I shall live forever;<br />
I shall never see harm;<br />
Affliction shall never touch my coat<br />
Let alone graze my cheek<br />
Nor blow up my skull.</p>
<p>Those who are wise<br />
And know Satan to be a judge<br />
Also know that he deals most bitterly<br />
With himself<br />
And cannot ascend to put us all in hell.</p>
<p>He can never ascend to be Master of Hell<br />
For he declares from the outset<br />
That he is the victim<br />
And the sufferer.</p>
<p>Satan can give you grace like Enlil.<br />
He can come with beauty<br />
And call himself Bel, the Babylonian Baal;<br />
He can even appear as a prince or herald of light<br />
But there will always be the darkness<br />
In his heart and in his soul.<br />
It will be there in his eyes.</p>
<p>Satan visited me in the third year;<br />
There were some devils that came around<br />
In the second year.<br />
They wanted to offer me the world.<br />
Satan says, I can make you rich and powerful.</p>
<p>Today, they invest their energies<br />
Into destroying me.<br />
I hear voices from my waking up<br />
To my lying down.<br />
They just won’t let me rest.</p>
<p>Aphrodite kept tabs on me.<br />
She’s always had an eye out for me,<br />
Constantly spying on me.<br />
She says, He hates us too much;<br />
The child loathes the craft with bitterness;<br />
He hates us too much.</p>
<p>I found myself an enemy of Satan early.<br />
I just wasn’t cut out to walk with the enemy<br />
And I had a short fuse too.<br />
My obsession was taking down the craft;<br />
I wanted to destroy Masonry<br />
And Satanism together.<br />
I wanted to put out witchcraft entirely.</p>
<p>When Heilel comes,<br />
He can reinstitute the abominations<br />
But my soul shall surely not join the vile;<br />
I will not be with the wicked<br />
In whatever lodge in which they may be found.</p>
<p>These are the ones who honour murderers;<br />
They use Boaz and Tubal-cain as passwords<br />
And impose oaths of secrecy on free men;<br />
They take the free and bind him<br />
Like Aphrodite tying my feet<br />
So I cannot leave the country.</p>
<p>She’s still swearing I will never be great<br />
And I’m still swearing<br />
She shall surely die;<br />
Her blood be upon her head.</p>
<p>Some men tried to kill my mom and I;<br />
They tried to kill me in my first year of life,<br />
In my infancy, while I was still a baby<br />
Or a neonate.<br />
They must have been hitmen.<br />
They will surely die!<br />
They all go to hell.</p>
<p>When the devils came in,<br />
They spared their own servants<br />
But troubled my mind and my heart.<br />
What have I done to them?</p>
<p>They conspired against me<br />
And kept defaming and slandering me<br />
And they had Sin on their side<br />
Or so they thought<br />
And made the delusions strong.</p>
<p>They preyed on my vile affections<br />
And my weakness<br />
In that I loved a girl that should not profit<br />
And they made my bands strong<br />
And kept me in a cage, in a prison<br />
Where there was no breaking out.</p>
<p>Sin made my heart heavy.<br />
The moon god gave me hell;<br />
He ensured I had pain and lots of it,<br />
Pain of heart with GERD-like symptoms<br />
And he ruined many days.</p>
<p>The devils that came offended greatly.<br />
Satan impersonated me<br />
And he bore no resemblance to me.<br />
Each devil chooses a victim<br />
In each generation to attach to or harass<br />
And they sometimes have nothing in common<br />
With their elect victims.</p>
<p>I was taken to a psychiatrist.<br />
The one who treated me<br />
Heard the very voices I was hearing.<br />
They all feigned innocence<br />
And never admitted to hearing a voice.<br />
So, they treated me for a mental affliction<br />
And hell, artane and haldol gave me hell.</p>
<p>No one cared about me,<br />
No, not a single soul.<br />
They just left me to rot<br />
In my pitiful and afflicted state.<br />
I knew I had the solution to my afflictions<br />
But no one cared;<br />
They just couldn’t.</p>
<p>There was a K group<br />
Whose name Satan interpreted<br />
To mean Kofi’s work.<br />
I still don’t know if that’s the truth<br />
Or if the fool was playing me on that too.<br />
It has always been his manner<br />
To afflict and deceive.</p>
<p>The obsession with Friday<br />
Is maddening.<br />
Even Jesus died on that day<br />
And satanists still call the cross<br />
Satan’s great victory.</p>
<p>What will the Masons do to me?<br />
Will they rain curses on me<br />
Or cut my tongue,<br />
Pulling it out of its root<br />
Or will they send hitmen after me?</p>
<p>The world’s elite<br />
Have been doing their dirty jobs<br />
And serving Satan in their places<br />
For generations<br />
And no one has brought them to book.</p>
<p>These illumined fools<br />
Control destinies,<br />
Take down presidents,<br />
Create wars,<br />
Rule opposing sides in war<br />
And determine the fates<br />
Of whole nations and individuals alike.</p>
<p>They use programming methods<br />
And inbreeding to keep whole dynasties alive<br />
And serve Satan with their heart and soul.<br />
They are sold out to Asherah the Purchaser.<br />
They can only do evil<br />
And any goodness is a cover up.</p>
<p>Masonry says good and evil are alike,<br />
That light and darkness are the same,<br />
That all that matters is the brotherhood<br />
And righteousness is to<br />
Protect the interests of the brethren or sisters.</p>
<p>Isaiah would have been vexed.<br />
Woe unto those who call good evil<br />
And evil good,<br />
Who put light for darkness<br />
And darkness for light.</p>
<p>The measures of the craft are villainy;<br />
They, that enclave, ought to be criminalised<br />
And put out of business permanently.<br />
Their measures are measures of deceit;<br />
Their allegories are allegories of vanity;<br />
They breed vexation as long as the breath endures.</p>
<p>The morality of Masonry<br />
Quickly degenerates<br />
So that the square and compasses<br />
Become the Yoni Mudra.<br />
Masonry is not only an incubating womb<br />
For its seducible and gullible slaves<br />
But also the vulva of our limbic pleasures<br />
When inverted.</p>
<p>You can ask Satan or Baalzebub<br />
Or query the chicken-talking Aphrodite<br />
If you doubt me.<br />
In the tree of the knowledge of good and evil,<br />
Satan was Santana the mother<br />
And Freemasonry is her womb;</p>
<p>It spits out corruption and vile persons;<br />
It teaches us to sin<br />
That we may learn to despise good conduct<br />
And righteous and pure morality<br />
And chase sinful pleasures<br />
And fulfill the lusts and pride of the devil.</p>
<p>What do you think the G is for?<br />
Sin says it is a minimal string of tissue<br />
That we may use to cover our nakedness<br />
Like underpants.<br />
Others say it’s geometry<br />
While others go for Grand Architect</p>
<p>But many do not see G<br />
As standing for god or goddess.<br />
Why? Satan is the god of this world<br />
And we know the top guns are Masons.<br />
They swear by the Bible<br />
And bring Christians and Muslims together<br />
And say you must believe in a god to come in.</p>
<p>These are the greatest atheists<br />
You will ever find<br />
For they are vilely opposed to the blessed Lord<br />
And yet some are our pastors<br />
And others are prophets<br />
While others are Islamic leaders.</p>
<p>Masonry is like Catholicism;<br />
Any villainy goes<br />
As long as it is Shiva or Shakti<br />
And not the true God.<br />
They just can’t bear to speak the truth<br />
Because then Satan will have to be humble<br />
And the odinits will collapse<br />
And the enemy will not be able to afflict<br />
Or harm or cause pain.</p>
<p>Talk of Shakti<br />
Or feminine divine power,<br />
Active and dynamic in working,<br />
The consort of Shiva the dancer,<br />
Don’t you think the Hindu Shakti is Ningal<br />
And that the image of Heilel,<br />
That is, Shadel or Allah, is Shiva’s darling?<br />
I wonder what she is pooping out?<br />
Please don’t defecate in my presence!<br />
Go and dig a hole on Korean soil in the north.</p>
<p>Masonry is blasphemy,<br />
Continually blaspheming<br />
And working abomination<br />
Against the spirit of righteousness<br />
And they can’t see their wrong.<br />
They would rather defend ungodliness.</p>
<p>By the way, Araphel, the gloomy darkness,<br />
Is the spirit of righteousness<br />
And it burns my heart that, he,<br />
As Raqia, is not a saint and cannot save.<br />
For all his righteousness,<br />
The earth is still heavy and laden with sin.<br />
Roar in sevens, O great thunderer!</p>
<p>The god of Masonry is Satan<br />
Who substitutes with his wife and concubine<br />
For Jehovah who made heaven and earth.</p>
<p>Jahbulon of Masonry<br />
Is like unto Baphomet of Satanism.<br />
Don’t Freemasons drink from a skull<br />
And are they not en route to the blazing furnace?<br />
Baphomet is Baal, Satan and Baalzebub.</p>
<p>In Baphomet, Satan is Priapus,<br />
Whose generative organ is the exalted phallus.<br />
Why do you think Masons<br />
And the blind illuminated ones<br />
Erect obelisks?</p>
<p>To worship Satan’s fertilising organ<br />
Which gives birth to villainy and corruption<br />
With death and lots of pain.<br />
His phallus, like Baalzebub’s, is most bitter<br />
And distasteful;<br />
Only the death ones shall desire it.</p>
<p>The girl I loved,<br />
Who broke my heart,<br />
She shall cave in to the darkness<br />
And fall with her father.<br />
None of them shall enjoy bliss.</p>
<p>They shall go to hell<br />
Staring at the barrenness<br />
Come out of Satan<br />
And the dryness of the ground<br />
That cannot be salvaged.</p>
<p>Let Satan’s obelisk be barren.<br />
Masonry is truly a vexation to the soul;<br />
My spirit is vexed at the abominations.<br />
A girl I Ioved ruined me;<br />
All these wicked ones who turn love into lust<br />
And deny a man looking for joy<br />
The pleasure of simple bliss<br />
And his fragile innocence,<br />
They shall go into perdition.</p>
<p>I swear they shall not find mercy.<br />
They shall look for mercy<br />
And find gnashing of teeth instead<br />
With incessant blaspheming<br />
Of the God they say they loved.</p>
<p>They are persons of lip service.<br />
Her dad is a Freemason.<br />
He was ruining someone’s reputation on social media.<br />
I don’t know if he was seeking solidarity<br />
From his Masonic brothers.</p>
<p>These perverted individuals talk about light<br />
When they serve the darkness<br />
And have been partakers of the ways of Satan<br />
And have sat at his feet<br />
And received of his words.<br />
They shall defend the craft to their demise.</p>
<p>We know who Baal is.<br />
He is a shirtless fool<br />
Baring his chest<br />
Like the accursed Pseudomic<br />
Trying to seduce the girls.</p>
<p>Pseudomic is an ESFP male.<br />
He is all about entertainment;<br />
He shall entertain with his burning.<br />
They shall burn in the light.</p>
<p>Asherah is a predatory leech.<br />
She says she is the happy Shiva,<br />
The Lord of Nataraja,<br />
Dancing her way to the destruction<br />
That grace provides.</p>
<p>Enlil himself showed that<br />
Grace ends in death<br />
For where grace abounds,<br />
Sin also abounds and grows<br />
And when things flip over,<br />
The natural outcome is death.</p>
<p>Asherah is a predatory leech;<br />
She is the horseleech<br />
That can never be satisfied.<br />
Her two daughters are<br />
A masculinized Veredel<br />
And Aphrodite,<br />
The Greek goddess of lust and war.</p>
<p>Aphrodite chose the right victim<br />
To attach to and shepherd<br />
As a guardian angel.</p>
<p>Asherah is a predatory leech;<br />
She seeks a consort, a consort king<br />
To swallow up into herself and digest<br />
Just like Ninhursag seeks a meal.<br />
Asherah’s preferred meal is Satan,<br />
Her brother who sits and orbits just above her.</p>
<p>Pseudomic is an ESFP like Asherah.<br />
They are a disgrace to the ESFP earth.<br />
They are a shame to Adamah.<br />
He is a spitting cobra<br />
While Asherah is a predatory leech.</p>
<p>The boy with whom I walked,<br />
With whom I ate from the same bowl<br />
Has betrayed me;<br />
This is truly Judas Iscariot;<br />
He goes to hell with the faller.</p>
<p>His grandfather was a lodge member;<br />
These curses and wickedness run in generations<br />
And you wonder why God<br />
Wanted all the Canaanites dead<br />
Judging them as vile, filthy<br />
And highly infectious!</p>
<p>Because Satan knows him,<br />
He walks about in peace.<br />
The devils seek his welfare<br />
And he is currently prospering  
While I am harassed and battered.<br />
I want to quit;<br />
I want to end this hell<br />
And let satans serve themselves.<br />
How can I be a servant to my enemies?<br />
</p>
<p>Pseudomic is a disease.<br />
His mother is Delilah.<br />
The devil went about desecrating my name<br />
And he called himself a minister too,<br />
A minister of God;</p>
<p>He was a control freak<br />
And loved to flatter, love-bombing;<br />
No wonder he is found a false prophet<br />
And for all his glory,<br />
Cannot command fire from heaven.</p>
<p>Qerenel, the great On,<br />
Will not give him that glory<br />
Neither will the angel over fire<br />
Sanction it!</p>
<p>They used to call me Commander in those days.<br />
I was in the same room with him<br />
When he called someone on the phone,<br />
Whether he truly called or faked it I do not know.<br />
He has always been a mocker<br />
Full of jealousy and greed and envy;<br />
He called asking if the person<br />
Knew who a Commander was in Freemasonry.</p>
<p>These are the ones you want forgiven?<br />
Perverts and fools?<br />
My hatred for the craft runs deep;<br />
These wicked ones have kept us in poverty.<br />
Like Aphrodite, Marduk, Enlil, Nanel<br />
And Baalzebub,<br />
Like the whole Assyrio-Babylonian host,<br />
They have vowed that we shall never be great.</p>
<p>In those days, fear was on every side.<br />
I strengthened myself<br />
By learning a little from the SAS<br />
And I would watch videos on the Special Forces<br />
Because my enemies are devils<br />
And satanists and Masons<br />
Will stop at nothing<br />
To take you down psychologically.</p>
<p>They are experts at defamation.<br />
They serve Satan, the grand architect<br />
And father of lies, the deceiver and traducer<br />
Who will stop at nothing<br />
To make a quiet soul frail<br />
And to break the heart of the poor.</p>
<p>Will a man rob God?<br />
Why should a man have to rob God<br />
When a spitting cobra can rob an adam?<br />
The 99-tob satan that Pseudomic is<br />
Robbed me of my peace and sanity.<br />
I was cooked; I was furious.</p>
<p>Following the microbiology exam in third year,<br />
The first microbiology exam<br />
In the first semester mid-sem exams,<br />
Which we wrote during the third week of April,</p>
<p>In the fifteenth week of the year,<br />
I heard the voice of Pseudomic<br />
Or the voice of his reject;<br />
He was gossiping about me<br />
And defaming me to my neighbours.</p>
<p>He gossiped about how I answered my questions,<br />
How I answered all the questions<br />
On the question paper<br />
Before I would begin to shade.</p>
<p>They made life hell for me<br />
And imposed their laws on me.<br />
They worked hard to guilt-trip me<br />
In the matter of past questions<br />
And I swear I hated him and his reject<br />
With great bitterness.</p>
<p>I later fell for his reject.<br />
She dealt bitterly with me.<br />
She said it was payback time<br />
And she wasn’t joking.</p>
<p>All that time,<br />
Sin was impressed with his work.<br />
He pursued Aphrodite with passion.<br />
He was afraid of his lust for Baalzebub<br />
And it reflected in my vain life.<br />
If these fools want to defecate,<br />
They can go outside<br />
And deface Adamah.<br />
Don’t spread dung in the Holy Place.</p>
<p>Cupid was with me,<br />
That chubby cub of Aphrodite<br />
Who would later speak in my hearing<br />
And earn the nickname, the Kid,<br />
The prince of foolishness.</p>
<p>Cupid or Eros was Aphrodite’s baby<br />
Like Satan is Baalzebul’s thunderbolt<br />
Or Zeus’s lightning.<br />
Cupid troubled me greatly.</p>
<p>I don’t know where these emotions come from;<br />
Whoever is responsible for them,<br />
Let curses be on his soul.</p>
<p>Cupid used to mock me in those days.<br />
He said he loved me.<br />
He was also the one pleading the blood of Jesus<br />
When Satan struck.</p>
<p>He mocked me incessantly.<br />
He used to say that even he,<br />
As a child, knew<br />
But that I could not discern<br />
Who Satan was.</p>
<p>In those days,<br />
Satan used to call himself Michael<br />
And Dionysus would call himself Lucifer<br />
And they would speak stupidity.</p>
<p>The reject of Pseudomic is cruel.<br />
She troubled me greatly.<br />
She trusted in a satan.</p>
<p>She confided in Pseudomic<br />
And he bid me confide in her.<br />
They were working something out<br />
And he was using codes and such like.<br />
These Masons are a real vexation to the soul<br />
And they only build vanity.<br />
Their works shall not stand.</p>
<p>They plotted against me;<br />
She cared only about her emotions.<br />
Wherever villainy points,<br />
There we go!</p>
<p>Pseudomic made mention of Tehillah;<br />
He wanted me to confide in his reject.<br />
He wanted to build a relationship<br />
Between us</p>
<p>And<br />
Now that I think about it;<br />
Aphrodite and Sin work best together.<br />
There’s too much conflict<br />
Between the work of Sin and Baalzebub.</p>
<p>Aphrodite promotes sensual lust,<br />
The lust of the eyes<br />
And wants that to endure forever;<br />
Sin touts sexual desire<br />
And wants it to endure forever<br />
But Baalzebub brings the act and deed<br />
And like Marduk,</p>
<p>Her work terminates the work<br />
Of Aphrodite and Sin<br />
Even if it be for a season.<br />
It’s like the Baal cycle<br />
And like how male bees die in intimacy</p>
<p>Except this time,<br />
It is Aphrodite and Sin<br />
Resurrecting themselves<br />
As Baalzebub caps their work<br />
And brings them death.</p>
<p>I say, still Baalzebub is the Inanna,<br />
The daughter and consort of Nanna.<br />
I say, Sin fears his passions for Asherah<br />
Who is Bel the Great of Babylon<br />
And chooses instead to gravitate<br />
Towards Aphrodite<br />
Substituting Veredel for Aphrodite in my life.<br />
These fools have been treating my life<br />
As a drama piece or an experiment.</p>
<p>I too have reserved them for lab rats,<br />
All of them with the king,<br />
Squeaking at the onset<br />
Of the injection of pancuronium<br />
Without an anaesthetic.</p>
<p>I fell hard for Veredel<br />
But the reject gave me the darkness.<br />
She foreshadows the potency of Samael<br />
And Qerenel will give the order,<br />
The angel with power over fire<br />
Shall give the command<br />
For Satan to go down<br />
With his minions.</p>
<p>A blind and mute Satan<br />
Who cannot fly<br />
But is smart for himself<br />
Yokes himself with Heilel or Shadel<br />
That they might lead him to battle.</p>
<p>The yoke shall be broken<br />
Because of the anointing<br />
And Satan shall complete<br />
His two-hour course<br />
At the hands of Samael.</p>
<p>Do you want to know<br />
Who the true prince of Persia is?<br />
It is Samael.<br />
Satan withstood Gabriel for twenty one days<br />
But Samael writes the doom of the Babylonian empire<br />
And the reign of Cyrus the Persian begins.</p>
<p>For all her strength,<br />
Bel, that is, Asherah or Baalzebub,<br />
Could not protect Belshazzar<br />
And he fell.<br />
No one who puts their trust in Masonry<br />
Is secure;<br />
They are as chicken<br />
That are well fed in preparation for the slaughter.</p>
<p>Baalzebub’s lust is potent;<br />
She encodes sexuality<br />
And my score with her is zero.<br />
I’m satisfied.<br />
Marduk shall die before me.<br />
I shall have no progeny to suffer like I did<br />
Neither shall a son or daughter arise<br />
In my name to defame or desecrate it.</p>
<p>Baal is a goat,<br />
Even a goat with the body of a female<br />
Standing at the right side of my bed<br />
And staring down at me.<br />
He came for the lust;<br />
He shall return with bitterness<br />
With his hands on his head;<br />
He shall not confess his sins<br />
Because the Catholic is vile and barren.</p>
<p>There were many goats in those days.<br />
Even Satan as a goat gored me to death.<br />
I still live so he calls me a god.<br />
I sat with Baalzebub in a boat.<br />
She brought toxic gas to take me out.<br />
I looked for the moon.<br />
Is Nanna with Bel?<br />
He shall rule over his lord.</p>
<p>Underneath was an abyss of water;<br />
It was deep and large.<br />
Why does Bel loathe me so much?<br />
She wants my downfall;<br />
She will swim in the depths of hell’s magma.</p>
<p>So Satan is Priapus,<br />
The Pho of Baphomet.<br />
Baal is the Ba of Baphomet<br />
And is also Dumuzid,<br />
The son, like Hermes, of Satan<br />
And Baalzebub.</p>
<p>Baalzebub is the Met of Baphomet.<br />
She is Metatron<br />
As well as the meeting point of all things vile.<br />
She is the mediator of the covenant of satanism.<br />
She is the threat, as queen of heaven<br />
In the face of Enoch<br />
Who makes him a chicken.</p>
<p>Baalzebub goes far;<br />
She goes beyond her boundaries.<br />
She overflows and spills over.<br />
Her cup in her hand<br />
Is full of sorceries and abominations<br />
Like the disgusting cup of Heilel.</p>
<p>Hermes has drunk from it<br />
And awaits the coming of hell.<br />
She has filled our world with perversion.<br />
Aphrodite, leave simpletons in peace!<br />
They are too frail!</p>
<p>Baalzebub stands for villainy.<br />
She is jealous for herself<br />
And for her Satan,<br />
The only 1-tob satan there is<br />
In the whole wide world.<br />
She shall mourn forever.<br />
Because of her lack of fear,<br />
She shall mourn sore like doves.</p>
<p>Satanism has a divine couple;<br />
It is made up of a triple goddess<br />
And a god.<br />
The god is the sorrowful Pan<br />
Who plays his flute.<br />
Pan is Odin, the god of pain and iblis.<br />
Pan is Satan, singer of dirges.</p>
<p>Satan, have you a voice like Heilel?<br />
Baalzebul is calling out to me;<br />
Satan keeps coming after me.<br />
Pseudomic loved to sing.<br />
He violated my image several times<br />
On social media<br />
And played his messages out loud so I would hear.<br />
He treated me like a satan<br />
Needing deliverance and healing.</p>
<p>He was constantly talking about lust;<br />
Eei, this guy is brother to Baal, the prince of lust,<br />
And can put away a lass as he deems fit.<br />
He was always looking for the opportunity  
To dispose of his reject<br />
And his goal was to dump her on me<br />
So he could go in for the architect<br />
And build his ``and they lived happily ever after’’.</p>
<p>I don’t know if his reject was blind<br />
Or if she was deluded<br />
And under the influence.<br />
I tell you, Baal is closer to the heart of the Asante<br />
Than he is to the remote Canaanite.<br />
Komfo Anokye is dead; He failed<br />
Because he is a traitor to God and to the Eveawo.</p>
<p>A stupid lass told Pseudomic to put a red thing,<br />
Yeah, something red on my slippers.<br />
That child of darkness<br />
Has been practising witchcraft<br />
Since the beginning of our stay together,</p>
<p>Putting his phone on my phone,<br />
Getting the girls on his side<br />
And desecrating my name<br />
While keeping his foodstuff to himself<br />
And asking me to prepare mine for him.<br />
He drained me; He was as a leech.</p>
<p>Marduk is a SEAL;<br />
He is a Komodo, leviathan and dragon.<br />
There is no profit in dragons;<br />
They spit water or a cryogeniser<br />
And not fire;<br />
They are empty, cold beings.</p>
<p>Satan is Pan, the god of witchcraft.<br />
He is the epitome of sorrow and pain.<br />
Baal is Apollo.<br />
Trust me, Baal, like Asherah, shall not be happy.</p>
<p>The triple goddess of witchcraft is<br />
Baalzebub, Aphrodite and Marduk.<br />
Marduk is the codebase male among the goddesses<br />
Because he was the one who inverted<br />
Baalzebub and Satan’s gender in the tree.<br />
He asked Baalzebub to join Satan in the tree  
As Asherah<br />
Transforming the tree of death<br />
Into the tree of the knowledge of good and evil<br />
And it was a tall cedar tree too.</p>
<p>Marduk is the great lady Ningal<br />
And the lady Ninhursag taken together.<br />
She is the first who binds<br />
And displays the second as her trophy.</p>
<p>She is the lady of solo intimacy.<br />
She says to see what you can reap<br />
Out of yourself;<br />
She is the one who teaches self-abuse.</p>
<p>The Shinarian Heilel and her entourage,<br />
What do you think they build<br />
In the land of Shinar?<br />
Of course, Satan is more likely<br />
To trust a faithful Aphrodite who is a ruach<br />
In the war except that she is also blind.</p>
<p>Heilel builds a tower to honour sensual pleasures;<br />
She builds a ziggurat,<br />
A Babylonian prostitute’s temple<br />
In the shape of a glans penis<br />
To honour the great Marduk<br />
Who sits enthroned in the glans.</p>
<p>If I can destroy Marduk,<br />
Then maybe I can ascend.</p>
<p>Tell me, can Satan sing?<br />
No, Lucifer never led a choir.<br />
Satan and Baalzebub do not sing.<br />
Heilel is the one who praises God,<br />
Who was in the garden of Eden;<br />
He was there with Kabodel,<br />
Stationed there by Michael<br />
And Qerenel was the chakram-like sword,<br />
The double-edged flaming sword that was encircling<br />
And went all the way round.</p>
<p>To this day, the male INTJ Marduk,<br />
Described as subtle in the genesis,<br />
Still portrays himself as female to me.</p>
<p>He is the eighth kingdom<br />
And is of the seven kingdoms of Revelation.<br />
Now you see how perverse he is<br />
When you invert his cognitive stack<br />
And make him lead with Se.<br />
Marduk is a devil.</p>
<p>He cannot speak truth.<br />
He impersonates an ISFP I admired.<br />
His favour was that<br />
He spared me in high school<br />
But college would be different.</p>
<p>He is a false prophet.<br />
He prophesied life and knowledge for Eve<br />
And yet she had death and stupidity.<br />
Marduk himself died at the hands of Michael.</p>
<p>Freemasonry kills.<br />
It kills souls and destroys the destinies<br />
Of individuals and whole nations.<br />
I have seen their cruelty;<br />
These ones are guilty of treachery<br />
And high treason against society and families.</p>
<p>Their trust is to kill Michael;<br />
They want An dead.<br />
They want the ruler in the darkness,<br />
The non-faller destined to live forever,
To die and not rise again.</p>
<p>They want to kill the God of heaven;<br />
They want An dead<br />
So they can have<br />
Not only Moses’s heavenly body<br />
But also Armageddon<br />
And all the bodies or statues and houses<br />
Of the dead.</p>
<p>Why do you think Enlil is the chief of the idols?<br />
He wants me dead<br />
So Michael would also die.<br />
He neglects the knowledge<br />
That Michael is separate from me<br />
And lives on.<br />
Enlil wants to secure fleeting pleasures<br />
For his qedeshim and for Satan’s kingdom.<br />
I say, He shall not prosper.</p>
<p>Assyria and Sumeria shall fall.<br />
They shall not be successful.<br />
They want mammon,<br />
They want wealth with beauty,<br />
Even the mammon of unrighteousness.<br />
Let Hermes betray<br />
And let Enlil sell me into the hands of Aphrodite.</p>
<p>You will be surprised<br />
When you find yourself<br />
Calling on God to save you.<br />
There is no force;<br />
There is no power;<br />
There is only spirit.<br />
Your spirits, even your unconsciousnesses<br />
Are vanity;</p>
<p>They shall not profit.<br />
They shall not resurrect themselves.<br />
They cannot save.<br />
They are but mere mortals<br />
With no breath in the midst of them.<br />
Falling, they fall<br />
Like Enlil and Hermes, the fallers,<br />
Like Anak and Nephil, the fallen angels.</p>
<p>Let him heap wealth upon wealth.<br />
Satan cannot create in heaven.<br />
Stand and see the power<br />
Of the great and extolled arm of the LORD<br />
And judge if the G of the rotten square and compass<br />
Or the God unsearchable<br />
Is the King and mighty one of Israel,<br />
To whom belongeth holiness.</p>
<p>It hurts my heart<br />
That Freemasons go to church;<br />
We will trouble them.<br />
They shall have plagues.<br />
They shall curse God.<br />
They shall become vanity.<br />
They shall not endure.</p>
<p>Like a fleeting pleasure,<br />
Like a thing that passes by and is no more,<br />
Like a thing cast in the furnace,<br />
They shall not come out unscathed,<br />
They shall surely crumble at the heat.<br />
They shall fade away,<br />
Breathing their lives away<br />
And committing their spirits<br />
Into the hands of the King.</p>
<p>The devil tells me, Vinegar is sweet.<br />
If vinegar is sweet and smoke is pleasant,<br />
Then open your mouth wide<br />
And let’s fill it with substance.<br />
Open your eyes wide<br />
And feel the smoking wrath poured forth.</p>
<p>They think Qerenel a joke.<br />
God can do no evil<br />
For he is good only<br />
And thus we call him God.</p>
<p>O Satan, but see, you can’t see eye to eye<br />
With the great and holy one<br />
Though you appear before Michael<br />
And bid him stop hindering you in Job’s matter</p>
<p>And you think he can see eye to eye<br />
With you and speak mouth to mouth<br />
With you.<br />
Go to now, ask the prophets of old,<br />
Ask the historians and the scribes,<br />
The poets and the Greek,</p>
<p>Hate burns as an oven.<br />
It will not be quenched till desire is finished.<br />
Thou art the bride<br />
And the kalah of completion.<br />
Stand on the pinnacle;<br />
Thou shalt be broken to shivers.</p>
<p>When Shiva comes,<br />
She comes for big business.<br />
She comes for my head.<br />
She comes to kill.<br />
Shiva comes to destroy righteousness.</p>
<p>Purchase your people,<br />
O great Shiva.<br />
The tantric fools are all yours.<br />
It is not wisdom to steal from Satan.<br />
You shall have your people.<br />
They will roast in the fires.</p>
<p>Shiva, the great Asherah,<br />
Sought to make her work<br />
More acceptable to Sin<br />
So she went tantric;<br />
Let’s prolong intimacy, she said.<br />
Marduk was pleased; was she?</p>
<p>Surely, God shall come<br />
And execute judgment.<br />
He shall stir up jealousy<br />
Like a man of war.</p>
<p>I will mention the fall of Babylon,<br />
Which rising out of the earth<br />
Is soon crushed<br />
And overflown by the floodwaters.<br />
She is not strong.</p>
<p>Babylon is not Assyria.</p>
