<p>I like the breeze, <br>
The pleasant cold of the heavens, <br>
The fine morning <br>
And the sweet dawn.</p>
<p>The trees swirl from side to side; <br>
They are beside themselves with joy. <br>
Lebanon rejoices; <br>
The fields skip like calves; <br>
The cedars dance like young unicorns.</p>
<p>Behold the grass of the field, <br>
These that are excellent in form <br>
And beautiful, a constant delight to behold.</p>
<p>They send their roots down <br>
With the trees <br>
And are established in the earth <br>
From whence cometh their nourishment.</p>
<p>The sun also smiles from heaven; <br>
Helios sends out his rays; <br>
Shemesh shines from his house <br>
And says, Behold me, behold me; <br>
All the planets revolve around him.</p>
<p>The moon draws near to earth. <br>
He pulls on the sea? <br>
What doest thou Yareach? <br>
Wilt thou uproot the oceans?</p>
<p>Day and night, <br>
Summer and winter, <br>
Springtime and harvest, <br>
Times and seasons, <br>
All things continue as from the beginning.</p>
<p>The pleasantness of the delightful is not new <br>
And the wickedness of the odious has been. <br>
That which was is that which shall be <br>
And that which shall be is that which shall be after it.</p>
<p>When you see violent oppression, <br>
Remember who made the heavens <br>
And remember who gave the command <br>
That the heavens should be made <br>
In the first place.</p>
<p>If the light does shine, <br>
If God does indeed rule, <br>
If he knows what he is doing <br>
And you cannot add to his work, <br>
Then keep calm and hold up your end <br>
For your end shall be beautiful.</p>
<p>I walked me among the grasses. <br>
I said unto the plants, <br>
To the young shrubs, <br>
Learn from me and be ye gentle. <br>
Do not turn aside to iniquity.</p>
<p>Do not depart from the way of understanding; <br>
Do not strengthen yourself in sin. <br>
Say not, Grace and glory to the wicked <br>
And I shall put forth my hand to the spoil <br>
And destroy the innocent</p>
<p>For this is the way <br>
And the fools are they that serve God <br>
And follow after righteousness <br>
And know not pleasure and the joys of sin.</p>
<p>I tell you their steps lead to hell. <br>
Therefore say not after their words <br>
Neither be partakers in the sins of the wicked. <br>
Rejoice not in transgression.</p>
<p>Do not delight in sin. <br>
Give not thy strength to evil. <br>
Bend not thyself to seduction and delusion. <br>
Deliver thy souls as a lovely bird <br>
From the hand of the fowler.</p>
<p>I will declare the beauty of paradise, <br>
Even of the paradise of God <br>
Which Michael planted <br>
And made for Adam and his sons <br>
After him and with him.</p>
<p>The devil hated Adamah <br>
And was there to destroy the earth <br>
Even before Adam could appear. <br>
The Lord shall destroy them <br>
That destroy the earth.</p>
<p>Rejoice thyself in goodness <br>
And delight yourselves in the abundance of peace <br>
For righteousness shall flow down as a river <br>
And even Euphrates shall praise God, <br>
Even the Euphrates that Marduk trusts in</p>
<p>For Euphrates is tob <br>
And none of the tobs shall be lost <br>
And none of the ras shall fall. <br>
They shall be in the dwelling of justice <br>
And be satisfied with the abundance of ease.</p>
<p>Who is this that darkens the world, <br>
That brings death and sorrow <br>
And plague and famine, <br>
That dries up the grasses <br>
And causes the young shrubs to wither?</p>
<p>Who caused the fall <br>
And plunged the cosmos into chaos, <br>
That robbed us of peace <br>
And robbed the living of life?</p>
<p>Has thou seen the devil, <br>
Has thou seen his angel, <br>
Has thou seen his in-law?</p>
<p>Surely, there is an end. <br>
The iniquity shall stop her mouth <br>
And the wicked shall cease to see. <br>
Sight shall be given to the righteous <br>
And praises in the mouth of the holy.</p>
<p>O lilies, lilies of the field or pond, <br>
Be not like Iblis <br>
Who stood to destroy the earth <br>
And exalted himself <br>
Above every tree that is named.</p>
<p>His glory is his shame <br>
And he is Ishbosheth. <br>
He shall not excel <br>
For in him is much folly. <br>
Give him of his deeds <br>
And let him savour of his pains.</p>
<p>Draw near to the King, ye lilies. <br>
Draw near, draw near. <br>
Run from the devil <br>
And save your lives <br>
And deliver them from destruction <br>
For every green thing shall be saved; <br>
Be thou green in righteousness.</p>
<p>The birds of the sky fly, <br>
The fishes in the sea swim; <br>
There is the fish gadol, <br>
Even the great and huge fish <br>
Which swallowed Jonah.</p>
<p>The birds of heaven fly, <br>
The golden eagle with the bald, <br>
The peregrine falcon and the owl, <br>
The swan and the hawk; <br>
They all fly in the open firmament.</p>
<p>The worm creeps in the soil. <br>
Like a creeping plant, it moves. <br>
The worm moves on her belly <br>
Like the snake that hisses.</p>
<p>Dan shall be a serpent by the way, <br>
A serpent that bites the horse’s heel <br>
So that his rider shall fall backward. <br>
The viper did not bite the horse’s heel; <br>
The viper bit mine.</p>
<p>Hermes shall be that serpent; <br>
He shall be the viper <br>
That bites the heels of Michael’s horse <br>
So that Michael ben Mishchar <br>
Shall fall backward <br>
And Yirel shall be chief.</p>
<p>I was only a child <br>
When a scorpion stung me; <br>
It stung my right leg <br>
And I held that leg <br>
And my father anointed it with oil.</p>
<p>That scorpion shall not live. <br>
My brother quickly killed it. <br>
That scorpion is judged. <br>
It shall not make heaven.</p>
<p>In my university days, <br>
A centipede attacked me <br>
While I was at home. <br>
The crazy creature just wouldn’t give up <br>
And it was fast too.</p>
<p>That wretched creature won’t make heaven. <br>
I swear by my anger it shall surely die. <br>
It shall die the death of misery, <br>
Even the death of sinners <br>
With none to deliver it from hell.</p>
<p>The viper that bit me <br>
Bit me and snapped its jaws; <br>
It stuck its fangs into my flesh <br>
And refused to let go. <br>
It said to pour out blood. <br>
It said, I want your blood, <br>
I plead your blood.</p>
<p>So, I was attacked by a serpent <br>
But that wasn’t the end of it. <br>
Three leeches also came for me. <br>
Yeah, the serpent struck early. <br>
It came out into the open very early</p>
<p>While the horseleech hid behind <br>
And waited her turn <br>
Till she was overtried <br>
And could wait no longer. <br>
She received the baton from a cow, <br>
The kind the Indians venerate. <br>
That cow is Aphrodite the leech.</p>
<p>That leech that stuck itself <br>
Unto my skin and flesh <br>
With his teethed jaws <br>
Has refused to let go <br>
As it is to this day.</p>
<p>She drinks my blood <br>
And keeps draining my life-force <br>
But I’m still alive, <br>
A wonder to the witnesses, <br>
Even to this great cloud of witnesses <br>
That watch on like Roman spectators <br>
Witnessing lions tear Christians in the arena.</p>
<p>I’m sure there is goodness in nature. <br>
It will not always be humans killing cows <br>
Or lions tearing zebras <br>
Or tigers eating goats.</p>
<p>I’m sure there is goodness in nature. <br>
There will be the lion and the lamb, <br>
The python and the goat <br>
Lying down side by side <br>
Under a green vine tree <br>
And enjoying the beauty of the morning.</p>
<p>Michael as a lion <br>
Shall speak kindly <br>
To the Shunammite lamb.</p>
<p>O, who shall open the womb of Kabodel, <br>
Even the womb of Mishchar? <br>
Who shall unearth the seals <br>
And bring forth redemption, <br>
The redemption all creation groans <br>
And travails in birth pangs <br>
Longing to come to?</p>
<p>Do you truly desire righteousness <br>
And beauty, lots of beauty <br>
With excellence and the fineness of gold? <br>
Do you seek peace as for hid treasures <br>
Because that day shall surely come?</p>
<p>Heaven shall come out of God; <br>
It shall descend upon us <br>
And Adamah shall cease from her wrath <br>
And the seas from being troubled <br>
And the predators from devastating.</p>
<p>If a man would have peace, <br>
Let him know his strengths, <br>
Cause him to know his place, <br>
Even his place of peace <br>
That he may walk in it <br>
All the days of his life upon this earth <br>
And in heaven.</p>
<p>I lost a lot of peace <br>
Because I followed after vain persons; <br>
I hearkened unto the voice of a prophet <br>
As my parents reported it unto me <br>
And he must have prophesied by Mawu <br>
Or some other elil <br>
For the fruit thereof is most bitter.</p>
<p>By now, like the cedar fruit, <br>
You know nothing sweet <br>
Ever comes out of Mawu or Marduk; <br>
They should be called Mardulce <br>
For they mar every fabric of sweetness <br>
And then say that they have done no wrong.</p>
<p>If a man would have peace, <br>
Let him not follow perverts <br>
Nor run after them; <br>
Pull yourself away from Absalom. <br>
Do not be taken in with his beauty <br>
For Heilel shall not profit the rebel.</p>
<p>I had a little peace in the beginning; <br>
It was Mardulce who ruined me. <br>
She denied me first of every semblance of peace <br>
And that was not enough. <br>
She cursed my soul with lies.</p>
<p>Now, I’m stuck in wickedness. <br>
Have you any idea what my life feels like? <br>
It is as the prelude to hell, <br>
A kind of hell in its own right <br>
And a constant distasteful experience. <br>
None should desire it;
Baalzebub inflames it!</p>
<p>The prophets kept doing foolish things. <br>
They would not say anything wise. <br>
My dad held a hot phone to my ears <br>
And forced me to be prayed for. <br>
When I woke up the next day, <br>
I had headaches; <br>
I hated the prophets with bitterness</p>
<p>Because they despised me; <br>
They mocked me; <br>
They laughed me to scorn <br>
And the perverts called themselves holy.</p>
<p>There is one who has even sinned <br>
And despised fundamental laws <br>
And yet preaches salvation <br>
And refuses to reason. <br>
He thinks himself loved by God <br>
And yet Michael rejects him <br>
And Kabodel says, I know not his name.</p>
<p>Kabodel, out of whose womb comes life, <br>
Is the book of life. <br>
She rules over death <br>
And is superior to it. <br>
She is the saint from the infinity past, <br>
The other cherub with Heilel in the garden.</p>
<p>She also appeared to Isaiah <br>
And was the one on the right hand <br>
Above the enthroned Michael, <br>
The one who called out, <br>
Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of hosts; <br>
The whole earth is full of his glory.</p>
<p>At her voice, the posts of the door shook <br>
And the house was filled with smoke. <br>
She is the Son of God, the Bar, the Illai. <br>
She is Gaboah, the highest animate <br>
Of heaven and the celestial realm.</p>
<p>Heilel was the one who cleansed Isaiah’s lips <br>
And forgave sins like Jesus did. <br>
How is it then that Heilel later blasphemes <br>
And becomes the little horn <br>
That curses the Ancient of Days <br>
And the Son of Man?</p>
<p>I once knew a girl; <br>
We did a lot of work together. <br>
We would chat on WhatsApp <br>
And answer questions together. <br>
I was mad and out of my wits <br>
Over her and she had me for a ride.</p>
<p>I once knew a girl; <br>
I felt so much peace being by her side. <br>
We could have achieved things together. <br>
Yes, we could have achieved a lot <br>
But she betrayed me and mocked me. <br>
She lied about me</p>
<p>And about my language. <br>
She played games with my mind <br>
And said that she loved it. <br>
She even called me Baby <br>
And I was furious.</p>
<p>She tried to make me <br>
Into a lust puppet <br>
Like another girl I came to despise. <br>
I found myself asking, <br>
What is wrong with this people?</p>
<p>You see, the girl I loved <br>
Gave me a lot of sorrow, <br>
Great afflictions <br>
From the second year <br>
And she loved and enjoyed every bit of it. <br>
Talk of psychopathology <br>
And psychopathy.</p>
<p>This one is like a satan for a human; <br>
Such a shame to be with one. <br>
She shall not profit anyone; <br>
Thou knowest it that it is true.</p>
<p>We could have achieved a lot together. <br>
She was even the one who encouraged me <br>
In the early days to post my poems <br>
And even to add a copyright symbol <br>
So it could not be stolen by another.</p>
<p>Her friend even calls her kind <br>
And I myself have seen her <br>
Donate a hundred cedis to a mate in need <br>
And I was there when she rejected my ten cedis <br>
And returned it to me like a saint</p>
<p>And I was furious at myself for sinning <br>
And went before the God of heaven <br>
Who is great in compassion <br>
And I taught myself knowledge <br>
As I had heard from the scriptures <br>
And learnt that the one who gives to the rich <br>
Shall come to poverty.</p>
<p>Of a truth, the devils heard my cry; <br>
They said they would fulfill scripture <br>
And make me poor. <br>
They said that they would ruin me <br>
And make me miserable</p>
<p>So they came together <br>
And decided to afflict me mentally. <br>
They took me to the psychiatrist <br>
And I received a formal diagnosis. <br>
The doctor gave me my diagnosis <br>
And medicine.</p>
<p>It was formal; <br>
I had schizophrenia. <br>
Now, you satanists out there, <br>
I have made your work easier; <br>
It should be easier now to defame me <br>
Like you always do <br>
And have done to Dr Rebecca Brown.</p>
<p>Satanists are fools; <br>
They aren’t half as intelligent as I am. <br>
The most intelligent priest among them <br>
Is as lame of wisdom as an ostrich <br>
That buries her egg in the sand <br>
And says it is a rock that shall not perish.</p>
<p>You satanists out there, <br>
Wait for Heilel and not for me. <br>
I am a grave disappointment <br>
To the kingdom of Satan. <br>
I do not profit the darkness <br>
But Heilel will. <br>
I am sure.</p>
<p>Next time, let’s see if another lass <br>
Or woman will come <br>
And rob me of my peace. <br>
All the losers are damned. <br>
They shall not profit.</p>
<p>Give not thy strength to lasses <br>
Neither let chickens rule thee.</p>
<p>Aphrodite is a cow who speaks chicken. <br>
She is a leech and the firstborn of Baalzebub. <br>
Satan is a dragon who speaks flies and buzzing. <br>
Baalzebub is a leech who speaks duck. <br>
Nisroch is a duck.</p>
<p>I was there at a conference, <br>
A prayer conference actually. <br>
I heard dogs barking <br>
In the congregation.</p>
<p>Everyone heard dogs barking. <br>
We were all schizophrenic <br>
And hallucinating</p>
<p>Because the devils poured themselves <br>
Out upon us and the death ones yielded. <br>
No, the death ones actively did it.</p>
<p>That night, there was a heavy downpour <br>
As though to answer the prayer of the priest. <br>
The elements poured down water. <br>
The rain poured down <br>
Like streams out of the rock.</p>
<p>Once, there were thunderings; <br>
The devil spoke in the thunder, <br>
He said he had subjugated all powers; <br>
He was mocking Hermes <br>
As he called himself Lucifer.</p>
<p>God said, Ephraim is an unwise son. <br>
Who is Ephraim? <br>
Ephraim is Satan, the anti-INTJ <br>
But Ephraim can also be Hermes <br>
Or even Baalzebub.</p>
<p>I wonder why those who possess peace <br>
Do not guard it with jealousy. <br>
I wonder why no one cares about me. <br>
I sit in my place; <br>
I muse and I meditate. <br>
I wonder why there is no one with me.</p>
<p>When Jesus was on the cross, <br>
He called out, <br>
Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? <br>
My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?</p>
<p>Pseudomic told me, <br>
Never ask why, <br>
Never ask why <br>
But Pseudomic is a fool. <br>
Surely, I can’t heed his words.</p>
<p>Hmm, I had some questions for God. <br>
Could Pseudomic be right, <br>
The one who prays in toilets <br>
As though he prays to Baalzebub, <br>
The Yahoo and god of dung, <br>
The lord of the fly? <br>
That Baalzebub may well be Hermes also.</p>
<p>I had some questions for God. <br>
Did Satan pay me a visit <br>
To preach the message <br>
That he is the god who draws near to me? <br>
Is Satan mocking me like he mocks satanists? <br>
Is he trying to call me a fool?</p>
<p>Hermes stood beside me. <br>
I wrote that he stood behind me <br>
And that he is my friend and strong tower, <br>
That he is there with me <br>
When the storms are raging <br>
And that he fills me <br>
When my strength is draining.</p>
<p>I wrote thus <br>
Because, then, I thought that figure was Jesus; <br>
I didn’t know that it was Hermes. <br>
I didn’t know that he gave <br>
Heaven and hell revelations to Christians.</p>
<p>This false Jesus <br>
I saw leading me from Engineering Gate <br>
Away from the direction of my hostel <br>
As though to say he was with me <br>
In my afflictions and felt my pain <br>
And my disappointments. <br>
Heck, you orchestrated them.</p>
<p>This false Jesus was on the left side, <br>
Even on the left side of my bed <br>
At the time when I slept <br>
With my head away from the door. <br>
You remember how I said Baal was on the right side.</p>
<p>Hermes asked me what I wanted; <br>
He asked me like God asked Solomon; <br>
These perverts have corrupted the name <br>
Of the wisest man that ever walked the earth <br>
And put his name on the abominable <br>
Rite and religion of Masonry.</p>
<p>The Templars that despise the cross <br>
And urinate on it like Bohemians <br>
Are not satisfied but have returned <br>
To provoke us to anger <br>
With their villainy!</p>
<p>I did not hear Baal’s voice openly harass me; <br>
He maintained far more decorum <br>
Than Satan, Hermes, Aphrodite and Baalzebub did. <br>
You know in medicine, <br>
You examine from the right side of the patient.</p>
<p>It is clear Hermes wanted to destroy my studies <br>
Just as Enlil wanted to. <br>
Thus, Satan’s kingdom was partly divided <br>
Like iron and clay that cannot mix, <br>
Like nepheshim and ruachim that are divided.</p>
<p>Lucifer is Hermes <br>
Not just Baalzebub. <br>
Baalzebub is made of iron <br>
And dwells in 335‰ light <br>
But Hermes is made of steel <br>
And is 535‰ light.</p>
<p>His star is Tophet, <br>
Even the same Tophet <br>
That is prepared for the kings of satanism.</p>
<p>Pseudomic kept asking me for money. <br>
Buy bread for me; buy bread for me. <br>
He was from a rich family too. <br>
He is a spitting cobra not a leech.</p>
<p>He was trying to drain me of my resources. <br>
He was loaded with greed. <br>
He would not even return <br>
The Waakye seller’s change to her <br>
Though I pointed it out to him.</p>
<p>He sought to discredit me <br>
After the manner of satanists and Freemasons. <br>
All they do is silence dissidents <br>
Whether through defamation like satans <br>
Or through cold-blooded murder.</p>
<p>So what is there in this cosmos? <br>
Some are good and some are truly vile <br>
But none can satisfy <br>
Like a saint can. <br></p>
<p>Righteousness of character, <br>
A perfect and zealous nature <br>
Is to be priced above gold and rubies. <br>
You should be zealous for holiness <br>
After the manner of Melchizedek.</p>
<p>God has sworn and will not repent; <br>
Michael shall surely become an el <br>
And attain unto knowledge <br>
Under the course of Melchizedek.</p>
<p>Melchizedek ruled over the Jebusites <br>
And in his days there was peace <br>
For he is the prince of peace. <br>
He is Shiloh and Salem.</p>
<p>Gabriel, let me ask you. <br>
Is Kabodel a male or a female? <br>
Is Melchizedek male or female? <br>
Melchizedek is the saint Kabodel, <br>
The image of Shachar <br>
And the sole saint beside Shachar <br>
For more than one infinity infinitons.</p>
<p>Melchizedek is Illai <br>
And Shachar is Elyon. <br>
Shachar is God,</p>
<p>The doubly strong one <br>
Who combines El with On. <br>
He is made three times strong <br>
And rules by his yad in the yod.</p>
<p>Heilel wants to be like Elyon, <br>
He wants to be like the Most High. <br>
The ben Yalal Shachar wants to yalal. <br>
He will have a lot of sorrow.</p>
<p>Baalzebub wants to be the One. <br>
She says, I am and there is none else. <br>
She calls herself On. <br>
She calls herself strong.</p>
<p>But thou art a weakling. <br>
Thou shalt no more be called tender and delicate. <br>
Thou shalt be like Samson. <br>
They shall put out thine eyes.</p>
<p>Baalzebub shall go into perdition. <br>
She shall fall and none shall deliver her. <br>
She shall go down into the depths, <br>
Even the depths of the pit. <br>
Prepare a wildcard against her; <br>
Prepare several wildcards that may afflict her. <br>
I am in the number.</p>
<p>Do you know why Heilel rebels? <br>
Do you know why Zuriel of earth rebels? <br>
Do you know why the Tyrian king and prince rebel? <br>
They rebel because they love the devils;</p>
<p>They are covenanted with the shedim in love; <br>
They rebel because foolishness <br>
Dictates so and they must oblige; <br>
They lack wisdom.</p>
<p>Why do you think satanism <br>
Is called the Brotherhood? <br>
Why do you think they destroy so much life <br>
And spill so much blood <br>
And curse the earth and curse God?</p>
<p>Heilel cannot bear to remain faithful to a God <br>
Who afflicts her own <br>
And destroys the shedim <br>
And humiliates Baalzebub.</p>
<p>Gabriel has bound Heilel, <br>
Even Heilel’s heart to the shedim <br>
And she is become Satan’s eye <br>
And the wielder of Satan’s authority.</p>
<p>Listen to me, O little lilies, <br>
You who are excellent in form <br>
And have been declared precious; <br>
Listen to me, O lilies of the pond <br>
For the wicked shall consume away. <br>
They shall consume away standing.</p>
<p>Be ye meek and follow me. <br>
Pick up your crosses and choose peace. <br>
Pursue righteousness and be saintly. <br>
Choose holiness and cling to it</p>
<p>For the saints shall rule. <br>
They shall be the excellent in the cosmos. <br>
They shall bear rule to the ages <br>
Even world without end.</p>
<p>What do ye proclaim against me? <br>
What does the assembly of the cruel <br>
Devise against me? <br>
They only consult to cast me down; <br>
They are set in their ways. <br>
They can never be like the meek lilies.</p>
<p>I will teach ye excellent things; <br>
Sit down in the grass; <br>
Fold your legs and listen; <br>
Listen attentively to my words; <br>
Hear the voice that distils in your ears</p>
<p>For my voice shall be pleasant; <br>
It shall fall upon your ears <br>
Like the sweetness of the rain <br>
Or the light showers in spring.</p>
<p>It shall be like gold in the earth, <br>
Like a precious diamond <br>
That is worth dying for <br>
And even better living for.</p>
<p>It shall be your health and life. <br>
It shall deliver ye from darkness <br>
And your souls from the flaming grave <br>
And give ye hope and a future.</p>
<p>It shall establish your goings <br>
And make your paths broad; <br>
The narrow shall be enlarged. <br>
Ye shall grow fat and discern peace.</p>
<p>Spread your wings and soar. <br>
Look at the heights above. <br>
Spread your wings and soar. <br>
Lift up yourself and rise into the light.</p>
<p>Beauty is greatly to be desired. <br>
Fear the Lord and be great. <br>
Beauty is splendour; <br>
If it fades, many do lament.</p>
<p>I can imagine a lass, <br>
A beautiful lass. <br>
Her hair swirls in the sunlight <br>
On a bright new workday.</p>
<p>She is always happy; <br>
Her brother drew in my book; <br>
He drew a horse in my book <br>
And I added his name below it.</p>
<p>Do you know Sariel, <br>
One of the chief princes? <br>
You know Michael <br>
Who stands with and defends Gabriel <br>
But do you know Sariel?</p>
<p>The chief princes are five; <br>
They are Michael, <br>
The linked spirit of Enoch, <br>
Gabriel, Sariel and Samael.</p>
<p>Sariel of heaven is in charge of bliss; <br>
Her codebase determines <br>
How happy each person can be; <br>
She is the bringer of bliss and joy.</p>
<p>Do you know beauty? <br>
Have you seen Sariel of earth? <br>
She is the most beautiful, <br>
The most beautiful lass <br>
I have ever set eyes on.</p>
<p>Truly, earth is tob. <br>
The beauty of nature is glorious. <br>
The green trees in the sunshine, <br>
The snapping turtle <br>
Crushing a watermelon,</p>
<p>Truly life is beautiful <br>
And full of spectacular sights <br>
And diverse beauties; <br>
Each has its own glory.</p>
<p>Walk along the seashore. <br>
Behold the flying fish. <br>
Go close to a dolphin <br>
Or make friends with an octopus.</p>
<p>Walk along the seashore. <br>
Watch out for any crabs. <br>
Just enjoy the fine breeze <br>
And listen to the sound <br>
Of the waves <br>
As they crush on the seashore.</p>
<p>Truly life is full of life. <br>
Have you seen a lass as resplendent, <br>
Even as charming as my German Indian? <br>
She never got to hear it from me <br>
But, boy, was I moved by her beauty!</p>
<p>Truly life is gorgeous. <br>
Kabodel is your king <br>
And the sons of tsedek shall satisfy me; <br>
They shall make me glad <br>
More than wine the young men’s heart.</p>
<p>Call out to your companions. <br>
Bid them come and see righteousness. <br>
Witness the works of the Lord: <br>
What devastations and desolations <br>
He has wrought in the earth.</p>
<p>He makes wars to cease <br>
Unto the ends of the earth. <br>
He breaks the bow <br>
And cuts the spear in sunder. <br>
He burns the chariot in the fire.</p>
<p>He makes the seed die <br>
And brings up the young herb <br>
And gives life in abundance. <br>
He gives the command <br>
And the foundations of the earth are laid.</p>
<p>Though earth be furnished a full body, <br>
Yet Shinar’s ziggurat shall not be finished; <br>
It shall not be capped; <br>
It shall not be built to the ceiling <br>
Because we will destroy the works of Marduk.</p>
<p>Call the solemn assembly. <br>
This time, those in charge of the city <br>
Are not necessarily the seven spirits of God; <br>
Everyone is called to the battle, <br>
Even as many as shall respond to the Lord.</p>
<p>Come ye from far and near. <br>
Say ye to the princess, <br>
To the beautiful daughter of Zion, <br>
Thy King and father cometh; <br>
He rideth upon the holy earth that quakes; <br>
He runs to the kill.</p>
<p>Thy father, O daughter, <br>
Is a general; <br>
He is the chiefest of ten thousand, <br>
Even the chief in the cosmos.</p>
<p>Michael shall go before him; <br>
The sun of righteousness <br>
Shall shine from the east. <br>
When the enemy shall pour in like a flood, <br>
The holy spirit shall lift up the hedge against him; <br>
The door shall be slammed in his face.</p>
<p>Come ye, come ye to the king. <br>
The daughter of Tyre shall be there too. <br>
She shall be preserved in the time of war. <br>
She shall rejoice with thee, O Kabodel.</p>
<p>Come, O daughter, <br>
Come, O beloved and elect of the King, <br>
Her name is Mishchar; <br>
She bears the insignia of Shachar. <br>
She has his image.</p>
<p>The virgins her companions <br>
That accompany her <br>
Shall enter the King’s presence with singing; <br>
They shall sing and rejoice <br>
And sorrow and mourning shall be stayed.</p>
<p>Forget your father and his house. <br>
Come, join the king in his lair. <br>
Enter into the craggy palace, <br>
Come into the den <br>
And be protected from the war without.</p>
<p>The spirit of understanding said to me, <br>
The ENTP male declared to me and he said, <br>
The ivory palace that thou seest <br>
Is but a craggy den <br>
For his spirit shall live as a lion.</p>
<p>Upon mount Zion shall be deliverance; <br>
There shall be holiness <br>
And the Lord shall show us mercy</p>
<p>For strong is he that watches over our souls <br>
To save and to strengthen them. <br>
His name is the Lord <br>
And his remembrance is eternal, <br>
Even to the ages, world without end.</p>
<p>Know that in that day, Heilel shall live; <br>
The ben Shachar shall live and not die <br>
For great shall be the Lord <br>
And his peace and covering shall save.</p>
<p>Spread thy wings, O cherub, <br>
Fly thee to the west. <br>
Set up your throne in the great land. <br>
Rule thou over Europe.</p>
<p>Thus it shall be: <br>
Heilel shall rule over Europe. <br>
The daughter of Tyre, <br>
The daughter of Europa <br>
Shall ascend to Europe’s throne and reign.</p>
<p>Glory, O glory to the righteous. <br>
Everyone whose name is in the book, <br>
Even everyone lacking the death trait <br>
Shall be saved and preserved.</p>
<p>At that time <br>
Shall the sleeping Saint be aroused. <br>
He shall rise up and stand <br>
Executing the judgment of a saint.</p>
<p>Everyone shall be saved, <br>
Even everyone who shall be found <br>
Written in Kabodel, <br>
Even everyone in the book of life.</p>
<p>But you say, <br>
How shall Heilel live? <br>
Heilel shall live for she is a princess, <br>
A lady and daughter of the king; <br>
She shall live to the King’s glory.</p>
<p>The elect shall come to Jerusalem. <br>
There they shall encamp against us <br>
And there we shall destroy them <br>
And give up their bodies to the rot.</p>
<p>The feeble among the elect <br>
Shall have as it were the strength of David <br>
And David, even the chief, the strength of God. <br>
There, they shall batter the nations that offend.</p>
<p>War is decreed upon the nations. <br>
The end is drawing near <br>
And the nations shall know their shame <br>
And the people their glory that is marred.</p>
<p>Show decorum and honour. <br>
Honour the Lord and resist him not. <br>
Do not strive with God <br>
Though Jacob wrestles Peniel</p>
<p>For Peniel shall bless <br>
And Israel shall be blessed <br>
But the angel of the LORD shall curse <br>
And Meroz shall be cursed.</p>
<p>Rejoice, O ye saints with his people. <br>
Your brethren that thrust you out, <br>
Your nations that pursued you <br>
Shall fall down slain before you <br>
As in the day of Esther in Shushan.</p>
<p>They encamped against the camp of saints. <br>
The fire of God came down. <br>
It consumed them with their hosts <br>
As in the day of Sodom and Gomorrah.</p>
<p>They perished in the fire. <br>
They fell down slain. <br>
The sword shall devour the rest. <br>
Do not give them all to the fire.</p>
<p>Blessed is the King <br>
Who comes in the name of the Lord. <br>
Blessed is the Lord <br>
Who alone reigneth over all <br>
And is exalted above all.</p>
<p>Hear ye the words of Moses <br>
How he said that the Lord, <br>
Even God Most High is a man of war. <br>
He created not the universe in vain. <br>
He said not to worship in vain.</p>
<p>The idols of the nations shall fear. <br>
The idols of gold and silver, <br>
The idols of stone and wood, <br>
All these shall be thrown away.</p>
<p>Man shall see and know and understand <br>
That salvation does not come from Egypt. <br>
The pyramids of Egypt shall not save. <br>
Those who put their trust in Satan</p>
<p>And worship the goddess <br>
Shall be put to the worst before God; <br>
Their destruction comes burning like an oven. <br>
In that day, the law of the ra’ah shall be broken.</p>
<p>They too shall feel pain like us. <br>
They shall die in pain <br>
And begin to savour of their wickedness <br>
And perish; stumbling, they shall fall.</p>
<p>So the righteous shall be with God. <br>
They shall be on the Lord’s side <br>
In whatsoever country they find themselves. <br>
They shall bind princes <br>
And execute upon them the judgments written.</p>
<p>I will mention the lovingkindnesses of the Lord <br>
Which he has poured out upon us in his love. <br>
He holds us in his hands <br>
And calls us his children. <br>
He numbers our days to shalom. <br>
All of us shall dwell in Shiloh.</p>
