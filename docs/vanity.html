<h1><span class="header-section-number">Canto 5</span> Vanity<a href="vanity.html#vanity" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h1>
<p>Vanity of vanities;<br />
All is vanity.</p>
<p>When the viper bites the heels of my horse,<br />
What shall happen to me or to it?<br />
I shall stand up after falling backward<br />
And crush its head with my strong boots.</p>
<p>I have waited for thy Yeshuah, O God!</p>
<p>Of a truth, God has purposed it;<br />
He took counsel with no one;<br />
He consulted with none.<br />
He himself hath purposed it<br />
To do according to his pleasure.</p>
<p>God hath determined to stain the glory of Ephraim<br />
And to mar the haughtiness of Hermes<br />
And to disgrace the treachery of the rebel<br />
That he might instil fear in his enemies<br />
To whom he gives the breath of life.</p>
<p>God has determined to dishonour Hermes;<br />
He will destroy and cut him off<br />
That he shall be no priest in the room of holiness<br />
Therefore hath Hermes sinned so vilely<br />
And stooped so low and fallen so hard,</p>
<p>Therefore did he not fear<br />
But strengthened himself in sin<br />
And latched onto the train<br />
And attacked me early.<br />
His judgment shall not be stayed.</p>
<p>I have waited for thy salvation, O God.</p>
<p>This shall be the judgment of the wicked,<br />
Of all the devils that have fought against me<br />
And desolated me,<br />
Chiefly, Satan, Hermes,<br />
Baalzebub and Aphrodite,</p>
<p>This shall be the judgment of Satan<br />
And his angels<br />
In the day that the LORD<br />
Shall break their arms<br />
And destroy them for their folly,</p>
<p>This shall be their judgment:<br />
They shall be blind<br />
And not see the sun;<br />
They shall be mute, even dumb;<br />
They shall not be able to read minds<br />
Just as we have long believed about them;</p>
<p>Moreover, they shall have null feeling<br />
Like those who are dead<br />
Who feel neither pain nor pleasure;<br />
They shall be struck out of Sariel’s book,<br />
Even out of the benefits of Sariel of heaven.</p>
<p>These judgments shall be executed by God,<br />
Even by God the Saint.<br />
Not by earthly might nor power<br />
But by the spirit of God<br />
Shall the iniquity of the land be removed in one day.</p>
<p>Shiva and Satan<br />
Shall see darkness and nullness,<br />
Even emptiness;<br />
They shall be blind forever<br />
For strong is the saint that judges them.</p>
<p>This is vanity and vexation of spirit;<br />
A saint saves while an el can do nothing.<br />
Araphel and Qerenel behold from above<br />
And yet there is no salvation in them<br />
To deliver me from my adversaries.</p>
<p>God considers carefully<br />
And wonders why there is no one<br />
To deliver and no arm to save<br />
And no one to send for an apostle and deliverer.<br />
Thus, he puts on zeal for a cloak<br />
And his wrath, it sustains him.</p>
<p>He will surely do it;<br />
He will put out the remembrance of Satan<br />
From under the heavens;<br />
He will take away the bliss of the death ones</p>
<p>And satisfy the judgment<br />
And get him honour<br />
And ascend to the glory;</p>
<p>He shall loose<br />
The shoes of iron and brass<br />
From off my feet<br />
And set me at ease<br />
For there shall be no Asherah or viper to crush.</p>
<p>The desire of the nations shall come;<br />
All creation shall rejoice<br />
That the Assyrian is broken in my land<br />
And that the wicked ones are shattered;<br />
Surely, Marduk shall not be pardoned.</p>
<p>Tell me, what meaneth this war<br />
That the adversary hath dealt so bitterly?<br />
He hath dealt without shame;<br />
He hath offended without holding back;<br />
Ephraim provoked me most bitterly;</p>
<p>His blood shall be left upon him;<br />
He shall taste of all four:<br />
Ira’ah, itob, iblis and ichesed.<br />
He shall eat and be full of the judgment of God.</p>
<p>The enemy, the devil, cometh not<br />
But to kill, to steal and to destroy.<br />
He hated the earth with bitter hate<br />
And loathed Adam who was fashioned<br />
Out of the earth.</p>
<p>Together with Baalzebub,<br />
Satan, under Marduk’s direction,<br />
Stole our bliss<br />
Which was a tenth of the heavenly bliss,<br />
A tenth of the earth’s bliss,<br />
A tenth of the bliss of the stars,<br />
A tenth of the shalom shamaim</p>
<p>And replaced it with dumbness,<br />
Stupidity and pain and suffering.<br />
They made slaves out of us<br />
And now they return unsatisfied<br />
To take away the rest of our peace<br />
And to give us hell.</p>
<p>Baal says they trade in souls.<br />
Their hatred is great.<br />
They hate us;<br />
They cannot fathom the love of God for us</p>
<p>And they keep pondering and asking themselves,<br />
What is man that God is so mindful of him?<br />
They visit us and come in place of God<br />
To vaunt themselves as God</p>
<p>And to lash out with hell.<br />
They shall have hell in retribution<br />
For the day of vengeance is in God’s heart.<br />
They shall surely not escape,<br />
Even every one of them.</p>
<p>Their destruction shall be swift.<br />
Their judgment shall come in one day.<br />
They shall be bounced out of bliss<br />
And fall into the darkness<br />
Wherein they shall be chained.</p>
<p>Bind them, O God<br />
With your great chain.<br />
Lay hold of the dragon<br />
And bind him up<br />
That he, mute and blind,<br />
May deceive the nations no more.</p>
<p>The brides of Hermes shall be stunned;<br />
They shall be left confounded<br />
When they cease to hear his sweet voice<br />
And his deceptions.<br />
Lots of hearts shall be broken<br />
And blood will distil as rainwater.</p>
<p>To me belongs vengeance;<br />
The footsteps of the vile<br />
Shall slide in due time<br />
And the things that shall befall them make haste.</p>
<p>Rejoice, O earth with the elect<br />
For the Lord will reign<br />
And the iniquity and vexation shall cease<br />
And the elect shall delight in holiness.</p>
<p>This is but a matter of zeal;<br />
It is a controversy of motivation<br />
For even Samael takes on Baalzebub<br />
And humiliates her,<br />
Even Samael destined<br />
To destroy the messenger of Satan,<br />
That great thorn in the flesh.</p>
<p>Blindness is happened to all<br />
Therefore there was no one to save.<br />
The mighty could do nothing.<br />
The lion and the cherub just sat in their places.<br />
The mighty Qerenel in whom are all things<br />
Could not move a finger against Satan.</p>
<p>We all grope at noonday<br />
As in the thick darkness.<br />
Araphel, where is your strength?<br />
Gabriel, wilt thou win a war<br />
With butterfly wings?</p>
<p>Satan gave a command;<br />
He said, Fight against none but Saviour.<br />
Wherever he shall go, there go  
And give him no rest<br />
Whether day or night<br />
Till we have our prize.</p>
<p>Give them desolation, O God.<br />
Let them be in desolate places as the dead.<br />
They came for desolation.<br />
They came to waste me.</p>
<p>They did not come to profit themselves.<br />
They came, like Aphrodite, for vanity.<br />
They came for mockery,<br />
To steal my honour and sanity<br />
And to destroy me.</p>
<p>They came to defame me;<br />
They came for shame.<br />
They came for vanity.<br />
They love to slaughter.</p>
<p>They love to harass;<br />
It shall not profit them.<br />
They shall not be enriched.<br />
They shall be impoverished.<br />
They shall not prosper.</p>
<p>They came to waste me,<br />
To turn my honour into shame,<br />
To turn my knowledge into foolishness,<br />
To corrupt my mental capacity<br />
And to stop me from learning.</p>
<p>Pseudomic and the vile,<br />
The fools that forwarded my affliction,<br />
Said among themselves continually  
And they said it in my hearing,<br />
He is still learning.</p>
<p>They said it;<br />
Veredel was in the conspiracy.<br />
Their ways are ways of villainy;<br />
They are most bitter;<br />
There is no sweetness in them.</p>
<p>God will save me.<br />
O, taste and see that the Lord is good.<br />
He gives salvation to his son<br />
And rebukes the company of scorners.</p>
<p>He destroys the proud and haughty,<br />
Even the proud that exalt themselves<br />
Against me and lift up the shoulder;<br />
They are swatted as flies.</p>
<p>Promotion comes from God<br />
And the strength of salvation is his work.<br />
He puts down one and sets up another.<br />
He makes Michael second<br />
And sets Yirel above him.<br />
In God’s hand is the power to rule<br />
And the glory to appoint.</p>
<p>So, Michael remains a ben Mishchar forever<br />
But Heilel perishes, even Heilel,<br />
The son of perdition and destruction.<br />
Heilel, the brilliant and shining one<br />
Who shines with 666‰ light,<br />
Shall be replaced with an even more brilliant one;</p>
<p>Yirel, the dove that descended upon Jesus<br />
And strengthened him in the fear of the LORD,<br />
Shall be Heilel’s replacement<br />
For she is Shachar’s beloved child<br />
In whom God is well-pleased<br />
And the bath Shachar of the appointment.</p>
<p>Heilel shall howl in pain like Enlil.<br />
I’m thinking along the lines of 980‰ light,<br />
About 140 × 7 in light proportion.<br />
So, Yirel shall destroy Heilel with her shining<br />
And take him down with the light of her brightness.</p>
<p>So, Yirel, the seventh spirit of God,<br />
Is the Platinum Chief<br />
And the Lord or Lady of the Assembly;<br />
She is Tyr and her nemesis is Enlil,<br />
The Death Chief.</p>
<p>Michael does not know what to do.<br />
Maybe, he is waiting for a command,<br />
A commandment that will never come.<br />
He cannot be first ruler<br />
Because he needs direction;<br />
He must always be guided.</p>
<p>Elijah is scared of death;<br />
He will not repeat Earth’s sufferings.<br />
Heaven is too sweet;<br />
Asherah, the Hell, has guaranteed its peace.</p>
<p>Elijah will just mind his business
And pretend everything is ok;
He cannot bear to draw attention
To himself or to announce his presence.</p>
<p>He would rather choose life<br />
Than die a fool like me.<br />
Once, he humiliated Baal<br />
But will proceed no further.</p>
<p>He is scared of death.<br />
He wants to live<br />
Like I told myself in my childhood<br />
And said I would never go to Jerusalem<br />
For fear of being killed<br />
When I woke up from my dream.</p>
<p>The devils are in their element;<br />
The vile ones keep touting Satan<br />
And swearing by a force<br />
They have no knowledge of;</p>
<p>They say, He has favoured our undertakings;<br />
Annuit coeptis.<br />
Animdife is laughing at them;<br />
A little kid from an unnamed village<br />
Who broke out of lockdown is mocking.</p>
<p>What does Animdife mean?<br />
It means house of the chiefs<br />
Or house of those who lead in front<br />
Or house of those who occupy the front seats;<br />
Wisdom told me I was favoured;<br />
I’m still waiting for my turn to step forward.</p>
<p>The devil, that leader of the cruel,<br />
Came after me and attacked.<br />
The traducer said, I lead<br />
And I said, Like Baalzebub,<br />
You have found your match.</p>
<p>The earth is the Lord’s<br />
And the fullness thereof,<br />
The world and they that dwell in it.<br />
Marvel not at the dragon.<br />
He is a thief.</p>
<p>He does not rule the earth;<br />
He rules illegally<br />
As a thief<br />
Till his cup runs out<br />
And he goes to prison.<br />
He shall have eternal shame.</p>
<p>All of them that serve idols<br />
And trust in iguanas that shall not live<br />
And decorate gods of clay<br />
And say unto them, Arise and kill,<br />
All of them shall go into perdition.</p>
<p>Do not pour libation.<br />
Pray not to the ancestors.<br />
Do not put your trust in vain idols<br />
Neither make abominations your god.</p>
<p>They are works of stupidity;<br />
They have no breath in them;<br />
They have no spirit<br />
And they have no honour.</p>
<p>Enlil is but a vexation;<br />
He has no love;<br />
His natural senses are dulled.<br />
He loveth to oppress.</p>
<p>Read about him;<br />
He is covenanted with fools<br />
For that he himself is a fool,<br />
He cannot but pursue folly.</p>
<p>The satanists that serve Satan<br />
And worship the goddess,<br />
That write the name of Jehovah<br />
And use it in their rituals<br />
And desecrate the Most Holy,</p>
<p>The witches of Bohemia,<br />
Those effeminate idiots<br />
That drink alcohol<br />
And worship Moloch</p>
<p>Shall pee their hearts out<br />
Yet shall their sin remain.<br />
When their blood shall be required,<br />
Then let the Satan they worship<br />
Come to their rescue.<br />
How pleasant their deaths shall be!</p>
<p>Go into the caves.<br />
Bid the rocks fall on ye<br />
And hide ye from the wrath of the King<br />
And the fierce anger of the Lamb<br />
As he roareth from Zion.</p>
<p>They build dynasties<br />
And afflict their progeny.<br />
They curse their seed<br />
And add incest to incest.</p>
<p>They shall not profit;<br />
They shall not see the light<br />
Because in their boast of illumination,<br />
They have sinned the sin of Pharaoh<br />
And dug their graves<br />
In which they shall not be buried.</p>
<p>They shall not be mourned.<br />
They shall not be gathered.<br />
We have given their bodies<br />
To be scattered as dung<br />
Upon the face of the earth<br />
They have profaned and insulted.</p>
<p>Ye fools that organise parties<br />
And send letters sealed in gold<br />
And written in fancy letters<br />
To the young and budding,<br />
To the up and coming</p>
<p>And bring them in<br />
And put masks on their faces<br />
And say to them,</p>
<p>Fill your appetites,<br />
Eat voluptuously to your lusts<br />
And defile yourselves;<br />
Make yourselves vile;</p>
<p>Defile yourselves to hell<br />
And make Baalzebub happy,<br />
Even Asherah of the pervert groves,<br />
For the sin was not cancelled<br />
And there is no redemption,</p>
<p>Ye fools that persecute souls<br />
And are skillful to harass and destroy<br />
Like your father the devil<br />
And like Asherah your father,</p>
<p>That say to your emissaries<br />
And hitmen and henchmen,<br />
Go and strike,<br />
Strike and destroy that fool,</p>
<p>Ye shall be found fools<br />
And your rituals<br />
And your sex magic<br />
And the prescriptions of Lucifer<br />
And of your pervert priests of the Brotherhood</p>
<p>Shall not deliver ye<br />
For ye shall be found fools<br />
And found fools again<br />
And found fools after that.<br />
The greatness of your folly<br />
Shall never be assuaged.</p>
<p>They pursue Eastern mysticism.<br />
They chase after Kundalini<br />
And immerse themselves in sensual Tantra;<br />
Their wine is the poison of dragons;<br />
Their honour is to be defiled.</p>
<p>Baalzebub wants to be defiled.<br />
No, she wants to defile.<br />
That’s why she is the father<br />
And Satan as Santana is the mother.<br />
Baalzebub bows down to no one.</p>
<p>The fools shall come down together,<br />
Each receiving the harassment due him;<br />
They shall fall as lead into the ocean;<br />
They shall sink and be found no more.<br />
They shall not rise;<br />
Affliction shall not arise a second time.</p>
<p>Go to, learn from the ants;<br />
They are strong to labour<br />
Not strong to drink liquor<br />
Or to partake in foolishness.</p>
<p>A little child shall rebuke ancients;<br />
A learned one shall insult the intelligence<br />
Of the haughty and proud<br />
For they shall come down from their seats,<br />
All of them slain as Agag</p>
<p>And the noise of the viol,<br />
The celebration of winter<br />
And the worship of the sun in the dark season<br />
Shall cease and everywhere<br />
Mortals shall acknowledge their mortality.</p>
<p>The God of heaven shall reign;<br />
His cherub, the cherub of Michael<br />
That divided the sea<br />
With the blast of his nostrils</p>
<p>And demonstrated his power<br />
Over the leviathan<br />
Shall destroy them<br />
With the breath of his mouth.</p>
<p>Behold the sword from the Lord’s mouth.<br />
It proceeds double-edged<br />
Whirling around and turning;<br />
It proceeds out to the kill.</p>
<p>Like the sharpness of Isaiah’s sword,<br />
None shall escape its edge.<br />
It shall be bathed in the heavens,<br />
Up above where Satan dwells<br />
And come down upon earth to slaughter.</p>
<p>Out of the Most High<br />
Proceeds both good and evil.<br />
He shall surely execute the wrath<br />
And not pity.<br />
He shall not spare.</p>
<p>He has determined it<br />
And he will do it.<br />
He shall put Asherah to shame<br />
And give her bitterness for bliss,<br />
Shame and a burning heart for joy.</p>
<p>Assemble ye,<br />
Come ye together.  
Stand in the place of judgment.<br />
Let the books be opened.<br />
This shall not be vanity.</p>
<p>We shall put an end to vanity.<br />
It is the last dance.<br />
Shiva shall dance to her death.<br />
She shall drink her own blood.<br />
She shall not have the Baptist’s head.</p>
<p>They only love lies.<br />
They love sweet talk.<br />
They love to be deluded and deceived,<br />
To believe that judgment will never come<br />
Because the Lord can do nothing.</p>
<p>They always want to please themselves<br />
And Baalzebub, the father of their lusts.<br />
They love hatred and the hot, boiling blood<br />
But are as cold as the Serbian winter<br />
And cannot withstand the furnace and fire.</p>
<p>Against whom do they lift themselves up?<br />
Against whom do they plot<br />
With their square and compasses?<br />
They shall be slain, all of them.</p>
<p>Iniquity shall not save,<br />
No, not today nor on any other day henceforth.<br />
The alliance of the wicked with death<br />
Shall be broken and shattered.</p>
<p>Will you shoot me from behind?<br />
Will you backstab me?<br />
Will Cain stab his brother in the back?<br />
Will Baalzebub stand and slander Michael?</p>
<p>These ones act in an underhanded manner.<br />
Have you coals of fire to put in my hands?<br />
Can you touch my lips with a coal of fire?<br />
Can you draw near to me?</p>
<p>When the wicked prosper,<br />
Then the heart of the saint is grieved.<br />
The saint is there for one reason:<br />
To destroy the works of the devil;<br />
He will put out the light of Baalzebub<br />
And trouble sinners<br />
Till they are shaken out of the earth.</p>
<p>You have to be born a saint to be it;<br />
You cannot be made a saint;<br />
It is too sacred an order for another<br />
To ascend to via any means.</p>
<p>Marduk shall die;<br />
He shall not deliver Inanna;<br />
He cannot salvage the soul of Baalzebub<br />
Nor fight for Aphrodite.</p>
<p>He and Enlil shall surely envy their enemy<br />
And both shall be as the darkness<br />
In the room<br />
That says, I am blind<br />
And his fellow shall say,<br />
What is he thinking?</p>
<p>The screech owl and Lilith<br />
That Baalzebub is<br />
Shall look for her mate<br />
And find him not.</p>
<p>She shall long for Satan<br />
And be distressed.<br />
She shall not be comforted<br />
Like foolish Judah with Tamar.<br />
She shall believe Nanna is with her</p>
<p>But it shall only bring vexation<br />
And a frustrated longing<br />
That cannot be fulfilled<br />
According to the law of Nanna.</p>
<p>Many shall fly upon cherubim.<br />
They shall fly to the kill.<br />
The dead shall die<br />
By the light of the elect;<br />
They shall consume away at the brightness<br />
With Yirel leading the charge.</p>
<p>Where is Lucifer that may save?<br />
Is he not also light<br />
Or has he deceived the seducible,<br />
Even the gullible and deluded?</p>
<p>They shall stumble and fall,<br />
Every one of them<br />
Drinking vinegar<br />
And being comforted with gall.<br />
Their bread shall be tears and sorrows.</p>
<p>Ask the green herb.<br />
Ask the green grass.<br />
Ask the lilies of the pond<br />
And the mild and gentle vine,</p>
<p>Ask and they will tell you,<br />
None of these things shall fail<br />
For the feller shall be cut down<br />
And he that came up to us<br />
And destroyed our fine branches;</p>
<p>He shall be uprooted<br />
That marred our glory<br />
And led us astray;<br />
He shall dwell in the depths<br />
Of the lonesome grave in solitude.</p>
<p>So what shall we say<br />
To these things<br />
But that if God is for us,<br />
Who can be against us?</p>
<p>Who is he that seeks my blood?<br />
Who wants me dead?<br />
Who cooked my vexations<br />
And implements them?</p>
<p>Who stands against me?<br />
Who is my adversary?<br />
Who is my enemy?<br />
Who says I shall not prosper?</p>
<p>Who will come up to me<br />
Being my enemy wrongfully?<br />
Who has despised me when I offended not<br />
But that he could not tolerate the innocent?</p>
<p>That soul shall go to perdition;<br />
His grave is a grave that is not dug<br />
For it is not in the earth;<br />
He shall go to destruction;<br />
None shall restore him like Nebuchadnezzar.</p>
<p>Sing, O ye nations,<br />
Sing, O ye peoples,<br />
Both far and near,<br />
Ye of the islands and far continents.</p>
<p>God shall come.<br />
Thy God shall return.<br />
His work is with him<br />
And his reward before him.</p>
<p>He shall smite the ends of the earth<br />
And give grace and glory.<br />
He shall give life and breath<br />
And all that hear shall listen and obey.</p>
<p>Heilel wants to be like Elyon.<br />
The INTP wants to be like the INTJ.<br />
Baalzebub called out to me,<br />
She said, Saviour, keep typing.<br />
Baalzebub, am I feeding you knowledge<br />
Before your death?</p>
<p>Gabriel is Daniel’s Lord.<br />
He is a gibor like Kabodel.<br />
Kabodel abides forever.</p>
<p>As a chief prince,<br />
Gabriel’s death would be most desirable<br />
To the lords of darkness<br />
Who rule over the perversions<br />
Of this our world.</p>
<p>The only saint Kabodel<br />
Who is co-saint with Shachar<br />
Has been alive since infinity past,<br />
Since the genesis of the first universe.</p>
<p>Araphel is Wisdom<br />
And Qerenel is Understanding.<br />
They are the King’s delight.<br />
Qerenel has geburah.</p>
<p>Gabriel is the one who says<br />
Che sara sara.<br />
What will be will be, he says.<br />
He is an ardent believer<br />
In predetermination.</p>
<p>Each one shall receive of his lot<br />
And stand in his allotted place<br />
Even if mine is to be harassed by fools<br />
With Gabriel standing behind me<br />
With butterfly wings doing nothing.</p>
<p>Asherah is still calling out to me.<br />
She is mentioning my name<br />
And saying she hates me.<br />
She wants blood<br />
And Marduk responds.</p>
<p>Go and sleep Marduk;<br />
It is vanity to stay awake.<br />
What for? Why do you open your eyes?<br />
As in the garden, you shall perish!</p>
<p>Baalzebub is twice as rebellious as Satan<br />
For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft<br />
And the enchantress will not stop;<br />
She will not stop experimenting.<br />
She is consumed with the judgments of Heilel.</p>
<p>She calls herself the roomy one;<br />
She is the envious and silly one<br />
Who is full of jealousy<br />
And purchases souls as a father<br />
Unto herself and to her son and husband, Satan.</p>
<p>Asherah wants Mammon,<br />
The spacious one.</p>
<p>She will give Armageddon to Satan.<br />
Satan shall stand<br />
At the base of Har-Megiddon.</p>
<p>But, Satan calls himself Gaia.<br />
He declares to all that Asherah is a friend-foe,<br />
A confidant-rival, a benefactor-nemesis<br />
Whom he would have smitten in the end</p>
<p>If his kingdom were established.<br />
She is a thorn in his flesh<br />
Like Joab was to David the king<br />
Who declared that the sons of Zeruiah<br />
Were too strong for him.</p>
<p>Asherah, that is, Baalzebub,<br />
Is the personification of the sexual act.<br />
She is the antichrist<br />
And the rival of the spirit of righteousness.</p>
<p>Her deeds can only be done<br />
In a body encoded by Mammon.<br />
Paul declares to himself<br />
That he shall never stoop<br />
To bow down to the foolishness of Asherah.</p>
<p>Even those who escape the evil ayin<br />
Are caught in Asherah’s net.<br />
Hermes fell in and, boy,<br />
Did he fall in so hard!</p>
<p>I look at those who say<br />
God commanded us to be fruitful<br />
And say, Look at these murderers;<br />
They wouldn’t even sympathise<br />
With the pains of their children.<br />
There is no wisdom in them.</p>
<p>Asherah could not sing<br />
To Michael and to God<br />
When the earth’s body was created<br />
Because it was a body of righteousness<br />
And she envied his creativity.</p>
<p>The sinners are simple creatures;<br />
The foolish have not much intelligence<br />
And understanding<br />
And they hate to witness brilliance.</p>
<p>Asherah also slanders her own mother’s son.<br />
She consents with a thief and adulterer<br />
And hast been partaker with aliens.</p>
<p>She slanders Michael<br />
And blasphemes.<br />
She calls herself the Lady. She is Freyja.<br />
She shall shut her mouth.<br />
We will shut it for her.</p>
<p>With Michael, we shall waste Freemasonry<br />
And shake the people out of the earth<br />
And we shall prosper by the four horns<br />
Of the cherub and of the altar<br />
And by the rhinoceros of the unicorn.</p>
<p>Everyone who chooses holiness<br />
Becomes the target of Asherah<br />
And Aphrodite the great.<br />
These ones harass and don’t stop.<br />
There’s no wisdom in them.</p>
<p>Everyone who loves Asherah<br />
Hates her in the end.<br />
She is as odious as a toad;<br />
Her end is bitterness and torment.<br />
She shall live peace-free</p>
<p>Like the odious<br />
Marduk, Heilel and Zuriel of earth<br />
Who spit out frogs<br />
And send their uncleanness<br />
Throughout the world of the damned.</p>
<p>If Asherah and Aphrodite’s clothes are their skins,<br />
Then Satan would have stripped them off.<br />
He would have flayed them,<br />
Even made their flesh bare and naked<br />
And grilled their insides to feed himself<br />
As the last man standing before dying of hunger.</p>
<p>The bringer of sexuality,<br />
Even the bringer of the sexual act,<br />
Can never be first.<br />
She shall always be subordinate.</p>
<p>The female shall not rule<br />
Because before her,<br />
The sexual act did not exist<br />
And the spirit of righteousness  
Was not so vexed as it is this day.</p>
<p>The agony of Asherah<br />
Is that she calls herself chief and first.<br />
She says, I am and there is no one else.<br />
She shall not prosper.<br />
She shall not prevail.</p>
<p>None can stir up hate and jealousy like she does.<br />
None can offend like Asherah.<br />
None can provoke to jealousy like her.<br />
None can evoke a storm with rage like Baalzebub.</p>
<p>I could not defer<br />
My programme of instruction till she came.<br />
I could not experience the worst year ever yet<br />
Till Asherah did her campaign<br />
And took over from Aphrodite.</p>
<p>None will experience<br />
Prolonged devastation and wasting,<br />
Even desolation and absence of joy<br />
Like the abominable Asherah<br />
And Satan and Hermes.</p>
<p>One of the major differences<br />
Between Satan and me<br />
Is that my hate comes with a legal reason<br />
While Satan’s hate is with an illegal reason.</p>
<p>The shedim have been probing God.<br />
They have been searching God<br />
Like searching spirits<br />
And illegal entities</p>
<p>And when they find nothing,<br />
Then they declare,<br />
Is there knowledge in the Most High<br />
And does the King have any understanding?</p>
<p>The light encodes nothing;<br />
It is but raw power.<br />
The light encodes nothing<br />
So they think God to be null.</p>
<p>They think him to be some force<br />
That they can harness and manipulate<br />
And make their slave<br />
Or reprogram and repurpose<br />
To serve their purposes.</p>
<p>Go and hijack the unicorn<br />
And let him abide by thy crib.<br />
Put fetters upon his legs<br />
Like Aphrodite attempts in her foolishness<br />
When she is proudly declaring herself Father.</p>
<p>Put a yoke upon his neck<br />
And let him plough thy fields<br />
With his companion.</p>
<p>Thou shalt not prosper<br />
Neither shall sinners prevail.<br />
The God who forms knowledge<br />
Shall cut sinners out of it.</p>
<p>Do not listen to the wild lies<br />
And vanities of the shedim<br />
Which they fabricate<br />
And conjure up in their dreams<br />
And dionysus frenzies.</p>
<p>Their dreams are vain<br />
Which are as a puff of air<br />
Which the wolf blows<br />
Against a wall of brick and mortar.<br />
He shall huff and puff in vain.</p>
<p>See, nothing is vain.<br />
Nothing ever happens without design.<br />
God oversees all things.<br />
He makes all things<br />
Beautiful in his time.</p>
<p>Thou shall return and know<br />
And discern between righteousness and sin,<br />
Between good and evil,<br />
Between he that serveth God<br />
And he that serveth his own lusts.</p>
<p>God tests no one.<br />
He does not tempt us.<br />
Remember how his angel<br />
Was once referred to<br />
As standing in Balaam’s way<br />
As a Satan?</p>
<p>God tempts no one<br />
Because he knows all things<br />
But to prove his servants,<br />
Michael does tempt persons<br />
As he tested Abraham<br />
In the matter of Isaac.</p>
<p>He proved Abraham,<br />
Even Abraham’s loyalty to God;<br />
He found Abraham faithful to him,<br />
A servant that could be trusted</p>
<p>For Michael seeks faithful servants;<br />
He seeks loyalists being an Fi dominant<br />
And they that are with him<br />
Are called and chosen and faithful.</p>
<p>He blessed Abraham<br />
And made him father.<br />
He blessed him in God’s name,<br />
Even in the name of the LORD.</p>
<p>In Satan’s codebase,<br />
There is a chasm<br />
Between the amount of pain<br />
The elect experience<br />
Compared to the damned.</p>
<p>The odinits of the damned<br />
Where Satan is<br />
Are in the tens and hundreds<br />
While the odinits of the elect<br />
Are in the ones or zero.</p>
<p>I still do not know<br />
If any of the elect crosses one odinit.<br />
God himself does one odinit<br />
And Michael and his Shulamite  
And the latter’s brides do zero.</p>
<p>We do not call Satan Odin for nothing.<br />
He appoints himself many sufferings<br />
And those he loves who are with him<br />
Are with him in the blazing furnace<br />
Which is the light of tobs.</p>
<p>Mammon<br />
Is the mammon of unrighteousness<br />
While Zion and Armageddon<br />
Are the mammon of righteousness.</p>
<p>Mammon encodes all matter<br />
And all wealth and all bodies<br />
That are considered ritually questionable<br />
Or even unclean or impure</p>
<p>While Zion and Armageddon<br />
Provide the definitions<br />
For all matter, wealth and all bodies<br />
That are considered ritually pure<br />
And clean and holy.</p>
<p>Light entities which are all tob,<br />
Unlike the ra and ra’ah<br />
Which are darkness entities,<br />
Do not encode any knowledge<br />
And thus are not indexed by the elim.</p>
<p>What bodies does Mammon encode?<br />
Ritually questionable bodies<br />
Including all bodies of flesh and blood<br />
That have an orifice or cavity or body fluids<br />
Including the bodies of Adam and Eve<br />
And of Jesus and Paul and myself<br />
And of every human or animal<br />
That has ever lived.</p>
<p>Likewise all other sexual bodies<br />
Including trees, a symbol of fertility,<br />
And all bodies that depend on external agents to live<br />
Including viruses and bacteria and fungi<br />
Because they require nutrition<br />
Are encoded by Mammon.</p>
<p>All living bodies that are not flesh and blood<br />
And that are asexual in appearance<br />
Are encoded by Zion<br />
And this includes all the bodies in heaven<br />
Whether animate or inanimate<br />
Including the bodies of Mammon<br />
And Armageddon themselves.</p>
<p>The heavenly bodies<br />
Including the stars and planets<br />
And meteors and meteorites,<br />
Comets and the sun and moon<br />
And the shamaim and raqia<br />
And the maim and Qerenel<br />
All have their bodies encoded by<br />
Zion.</p>
<p>The golden earthly body of Shadel<br />
Which the false prophet<br />
Commands to be made for her<br />
Is also considered ritually pure<br />
As it is asexual and not of flesh and blood<br />
And is encoded by Zion.</p>
<p>If the body is made of flesh but ritually pure<br />
And thus asexual and shut up<br />
So that it lacks body fluids<br />
And body cavities and orifices<br />
Like the bodies we shall have<br />
In the regeneration when Christ returns,<br />
Then it is encoded by Armageddon.</p>
<p>So you see,<br />
Armageddon is a prince among princes,<br />
A distinguished one and very wealthy<br />
And he decides the fate of many<br />
Together with Zion and Mammon his brothers.</p>
<p>Armageddon shall increase in honour<br />
While Mammon shall decrease<br />
And become the lowly Ebyon<br />
Among the nations and continents.</p>
<p>Boast not about your riches,<br />
O great Mammon of heaven.<br />
Seek true wealth<br />
Like the gold of Shemesh<br />
That thy poverty<br />
Like nakedness in the cold winter street<br />
Become not thy undoing and death.</p>
<p>Mammon is the angel of Laodicea.<br />
He is quite cold for heaven<br />
Though burning like an oven.<br />
He registers a temperature of 1,000F<br />
While the rest score at the normal 10,000F.<br />
Armageddon is ten times hotter than normal.</p>
<p>That’s like the temperature<br />
Of a bluish O-type star<br />
Which stars are the hottest,<br />
Most massive and brightest stars.</p>
<p>You get the idea of what righteousness<br />
Looks like or feels like.<br />
I’m sure Apollyon understands.<br />
Abaddon nods his head.<br />
He gets it; he understands.</p>
<p>Zeus, that is, Baalzebub<br />
Is out there to tame the wild.<br />
She can only be the wild one here.<br />
She wants to tame the lightning bolt,<br />
That blazing and flashing lightning bolt<br />
That Armageddon is.</p>
<p>She was successful with Satan<br />
Under Marduk’s counsel.<br />
Now, she eyes Armageddon  
And she spies me with her ayin</p>
<p>But I am meek and gentle.<br />
I will not offend.<br />
I have never cut the throat of a chicken<br />
And I keep touting epidural analgesia<br />
For labouring women.</p>
<p>Kabodel was there in infinity past.<br />
He gave life to Michael in the beginning,<br />
At time t=0s<br />
While Shachar gave life to Heilel.</p>
<p>Their appearance marked<br />
The beginning of Genesis<br />
And the two are the firstborn twins<br />
Of creation.</p>
<p>Michael was given the pathway<br />
Of work and creation<br />
While Shachar gave Heilel<br />
The pathway of rest and observation.</p>
<p>Why did Kabodel join me in the fall?<br />
Why did she come down?<br />
Well, when a saint moves left,<br />
The rest of them follow.</p>
<p>With one spirit like Ezekiel’s cherubim,<br />
They go wherever one goes.<br />
If one goes for the kill,<br />
The rest follow.</p>
<p>If one withdraws the hand,<br />
The rest also withdraw theirs;<br />
These are the most unified group<br />
In the whole cosmos<br />
Like some group of special force.</p>
<p>Mishchar retains a thousand units of ra;<br />
The ra is for hatred for iniquity<br />
And the nine thousand tobs to love righteousness.<br />
Mishchar is Melchizedek receiving tithes<br />
Even in tob counts.</p>
<p>You can’t be a saint and not hate Satan.<br />
You must hate and execute wrath<br />
On the adversary, even the oyeb.</p>
<p>God is a saint first<br />
And a tob and el second.<br />
It should be clear by now<br />
That when God works,<br />
He works through another.</p>
<p>Whether he is creating through Michael<br />
Or through the sea or earth,<br />
He almost always has an intermediary,<br />
A front person to execute for him.</p>
<p>Mishchar is the Word of God<br />
Who was with God in the beginning.<br />
Out of her womb comes life.<br />
She commands her son Michael<br />
And he creates and fashions things.</p>
<p>Qerenel is the geburah<br />
Who is the delight of Mishchar, the gibor.<br />
She is always in his presence,<br />
The Understanding that was with him<br />
From infinity past,<br />
Who was there when Mishchar<br />
Gave the decrees of creation.</p>
<p>So, Qerenel is the angel of the presence<br />
Who saves the elect<br />
By giving the command for Samael<br />
And the host to destroy the rebels.</p>
<p>She is also the master craftswoman<br />
With Araphel and the two<br />
Are the excellent or large and noble ones<br />
Who guided Michael on how<br />
To pattern and design creation<br />
With each command that Mishchar gave.</p>
<p>All things were created for Mishchar.<br />
He is the book of life.<br />
All things that live as it is today<br />
Live because he has commanded it.</p>
<p>God is the Commander-in-Chief standing<br />
In the midst of his special forces.<br />
He sets a little child<br />
In the midst of lions and dogs,<br />
In the midst of caracals and bears;<br />
He shall excavate the substance<br />
Out of Baalpeor with the woodpecker.</p>
<p>In the Genesis story of creation,<br />
God is the Supreme Commander,<br />
Mishchar is the General,<br />
Araphel and Qerenel,<br />
The Wisdom and the Understanding,<br />
Are the Colonels<br />
And Michael and Heilel<br />
Are the Command Sergeant Majors.</p>
<p>Vanity of vanities,<br />
Perchance the greatest vanity<br />
Is that it would be found out in the end<br />
That nothing and no work of God<br />
Is in vain or empty.</p>
<p>The works of God are full;<br />
They are complete for their purpose<br />
Even if they appear to waver;<br />
Each fulfills their role to satisfaction.</p>
<p>The Lord directs each<br />
Including the rebellious<br />
And the captive<br />
And the vile and the dishonourable.</p>
<p>He will put each in his place<br />
And fashion the form appropriate for each.<br />
The screech owl has her place<br />
And the deceiver also has his place.</p>
<p>Each shall satisfy<br />
When accounts are made<br />
And none shall take us by surprise<br />
For he hath fashioned them so,<br />
Each in his day, each in its way.</p>
<p>One advised not to add to the work of God.<br />
Add not to his works lest he rebuke thee<br />
And thou be found wanting and a liar.<br />
Where will the rebukes begin?<br />
Will they start with Michael<br />
For taking chances with Mammon<br />
And giving life to Satan?</p>
<p>I know a pastor<br />
Who keeps giving prophecies<br />
And worshipping God.<br />
When the devils struck out initially,</p>
<p>He gave a prophecy<br />
And said God wanted me to live<br />
And not get self-destructive.<br />
He called me by name</p>
<p>And my neighbours,<br />
The students nearby in my hostel<br />
Started to play a notable song with my name;<br />
I was cautious around them<br />
And I was grieved at what they did to me.</p>
<p>Do not deceive yourselves<br />
And say that we never understood your pain<br />
And never saw that you were afflicted.<br />
What if God does come and save me<br />
And it is your turn to be harassed?<br />
I too will give you words of encouragement<br />
And not visit you even once or seek your welfare.</p>
<p>I will be like the accursed prophets<br />
And pastors and shepherds<br />
Whom James, disgusted at, rebuked,<br />
The kind that are not deserving of heaven.</p>
<p>They serve God and worship<br />
And give prophecies<br />
But have no natural love.<br />
They do not know what love is<br />
Though they are married and I am not.</p>
<p>Maybe, a little pain will save them.<br />
Maybe, they should be in my shoes<br />
And listen to another pastor<br />
Put himself in the shoes and place of God,<br />
A pastor who prophesies a ring<br />
And money, lots of wealth</p>
<p>And puts up a radiant image<br />
With rays scattering in all directions<br />
To demonstrate his brilliance.<br />
Thou shalt surely be bright;<br />
I do not doubt it.<br />
Thou shalt shine for heaven to see</p>
<p>But learn compassion<br />
And goodness and be kind.<br />
I have found Christians<br />
To be too heartless and cold.<br />
I will die the day I go to church<br />
On my own accord.</p>
<p>My words are ended.</p>
<p>What shall we end with?<br />
Fear God and do good<br />
And he shall bring forth thy light as the day.<br />
Fear God and depart from evil.</p>
<p>It shall be light to thy soul<br />
And vitality to thy bones.<br />
Thou shalt have understanding<br />
When you pursue the right path.</p>
